0,"apparently this is the first review for this company. i can't fathom why others have not reveiwed this company. my 23 year old garage door finally gave up the ghost the other nite. i got quotes from some competitors ranging from 750.00 to 1,100.00 dollars. both companies came immediately said i needed a new door. i expressed to them by budget was limited and a new door wasn't in that budget. a friend said contact aaa action doors. contacted josh (part owner)...told him my budget was limited. he came out took one look at the door,..said we got this it can be repaired w/o question..all that was needed was new metal bracing along the top and middle. he installed the metal bracing in less than 45 min....i had an operating door again..and saved a bunch of money."
1,i was very happy with greg and gc glass.  what i thought would be an expensive window replacement was actually a quick fix with minimal cost. greg is honest and knowledgeable.  will certainly call again if i have any further window repair.
2,"contacted happy handyman for a variety of odd jobs and they sent mark. he arrived on time and was very personable and professional. his work was exemplary, fixing all of the necessary items, and leaving them operating as though them were brand new. would definitely recommend them."
3,"saw another yelper writing that this stadium needs renovation.  nooooo!  leave it the way it is.  i have been to many of the complexes in the area.  while they have done a great job with the architecture of most of them, scottsdale stadium rocks because that it is old, a bit disjointed and cozy.  i went to the talking stick and saw a game yesterday, but left in the 6th inning to make my way to the giants/padre game.  whilst the other stadiums are sleepy and filled with snowbirds melting in the heat, scottsdale stadium is a party surrounding a baseball game.  leave it the way it is!"
4,thanks to shane and to kathy at kleinhenz  for their genuine warmth and professionalism. your repair of a family heirloom is so appreciated!
5,it took a little time for the repair but that's to be expected with quality work the owner even took the time to check on me to see if my product was doing well and if i was happy with my repair.
6,corey and the crew are spot on. they do great work at a fair price and deliver as promised. on time for me and my business is critical.  they have handled several projects and repairs. i have never been disappointed. highly recommended.
7,"lance was out a few weeks ago. busy season, go figure. i had a leak from under the driveway. they found it, rerouted lines and repaired the leak in a day. the cost was reasonable for the amount of time and work they spent. i appreciate lance's straightforward approach. he advised on costs for a worst case scenario which, thankfully, it wasn't. easy to contact and always responds (even though i happened to be out of the state at the time). the team was professional. if repairs are what you need i highly recommend this team."
8,organized and quick... why 4 and not 5.  my ignition switch wasn't in the factory installed spot so i had to repair it and re go through another day and was told by az dot it didn't matter later. so in effect i wasted a day and money on something but... quick and i will come to this location again
9,"i had robert out the first time for repair of my garage door two years ago and he was excellent.  my unit is over 12 years old and needed replacement so i requested him again today.  he is so good, very polite and thorough and explains everything very well.  he can figure anything out.  he did a great job and i highly recommend him."
10,"devon did shower repair for our mid century house.  it was not a typical repair, and many unexpected conditions were thrown at him.  he was a true professional, and his humor did not hurt in the whole process.  highly appreciated his effort."
11,"great place for kids to star learning how to use bow and arrows.  only gripe that i have, some of the arrows are worn out and may need repairs.  
kids had a blast !"
12,"i would recommend crash of rhinos!  our house looks brand new!  we had a lot of stucco repair that was meticulously repaired.  communication was a strength with daily status reports emailed to us nightly and they even kept us on track ahead of time with picking out colors.  finally, our three man team lead by jj had an amazing work ethic.  they started early and stayed late and were always working.  i will be calling them again next time i need painting done."
13,"we took a wooden toy for repair, which was done beautifully, quickly and reasonably. the repaired toy is truly better than new. love the work done here."
14,"ended up getting the dreaded hoa letter saying that i needed to repair our house. i was expecting it because we live on a golf course and have had our fair share of golf balls hitting our house. plus the paint was really starting to show wear so i wasn't too mad about the hoa. ended up getting a few quotes and decided on rhinos. i think the name drew me to them pulse all the great reviews they got. 

mike the owner came over and went over the estimate. he already did his homework and had the sq footage printed out through websites so he pretty much knew his estimate on the way over. my house was in need of stucco repair too. he ended up quoting me a fair estimate. i ended up going through an outside stucco repair and had mike do my paint only. he ended up working with me to meet my budget so i hired hi, on the spot. 

my house is two stories so it took them nearly 4 days to complete but the work was very well done. plus it comes with a 7 year warranty. rhinos uses quality name brand paint and they double coat everything. the quality is very good and i went from being embarrassed on the exterior of my house to be believing that i have one of the nicest homes on the block. 

i like local businesses and rhinos is based in glendale. if you are in the need for a repaint give them a call. you won't be disappointed."
15,pete is the best handyman in town! he gets in and gets the job done! he is super sweet and simply awesome! highly recommend him as a handyman!
16,"i had one wall that had some water damage in need of repair. william was very responsive at getting me quote and fitting me into his schedule. the patch and texture work looks perfect, and they were fast, getting it done in only a couple hours."
17,"i really had a great experience talking to lance.  i have been in it for the last 2 decades and yet he knows immensely more about printers than i.  he was able to explain options to me and was very fair in his suggestions. for example, he gave scenarios where it would be more cost effective to buy a new printer than fix an old one, but also explained situations that would make it better to repair, like if we have a large stockpile of toner.  we were not yet ready to make a purchase, but his options and warranty really made him a great deal.  when it comes time for me to refer other customers to him, he will certainly be my first stop."
18,"they do a good job, but always want to  upsell, which is annoying along with the window repair people."
19,so good! delightful atmosphere and my kids love the bathrooms - very creative and fun place. they are doing renovations now and i can't wait to see how they have changed it.
20,nothing but great is how i can describe this place. i have damaged three devices and taken them all to ifixaz and no complaints at all. they were nice and very competitive on the pricing. and they are very fast with the repairs. very convenient being located in north scottsdale.
21,"wow! amazing people! i went in thinking they did jewelry repair when they only sell jewelry, but the nice woman helped me fix my necklace anyways. i was so flustered at her kindness i didn't even get her name! thank you so much!"
22,we stopped here because the one we wanted to go is closed for renovation. and we are very happy with our decision. we ordered two kinds of noodles and two dishes and mini-dumplings. all are excellent. the waitress is very nice too. highly recommended.
23,i purchased a new ruud ac unit from arizona cold air in 2007 & it worked well for 10 years. when i turned it on for first time this year it was very obvious that something was seriously wrong. i called the company & told them i had purchased a warranty with it & they had all my information. my repair was extensive & totally covered-i was amazed!  great friendly staff & couldn't be more all around totally satisfied by the experience. i highly recommend them!
24,"jim and his crew are friendly, helpful and trustworthy, and experienced in a vast range of home repairs.  they communicate regularly throughout the process and provide step by step details of the job.    having a rental property out of state has it challenges and jim constantly keeps me in the loop, even sending pictures and videos.  i highly recommend all in one home repairs.   the work and professionalism are top notch.   i will defiantly be using them again!!!  thanks jim!"
25,"long overdue update:
not too long after work completed i found some areas on my home that were missed and that i didn't see on the initial final inspection. the house needed some stucco repair and paint touch up on a few areas. when i first called it felt like they were trying to brush off my concerns about the stucco and avoid a trip out. the scheduling also required about a month to have the work completed. 

the workers were amazing and were a pleasure to deal with both times they were on the property. overall, still a great company but wish the follow up could have gone a bit smoother. only giving four stars at this point."
26,"pete and his other handyman was great! they were on time, quick, and did a great job. i would def hire him again."
27,"i read some reviews and they pretty much have defined/evaluated this club by its age and that equipment is older and needs more maintenance. yes, this is true it is older and there are more repairs than newer stuff. and, from my experience in the past 5 years, the amazing value of this particular gym is it being the community it is for me. i don't know about other gyms but this one is a most wonderfully warm group of members and staff. i have learned, that in any situation (after my attitude), it always always thge people that make it what it is.  at this club it's most everyone's (members and staff) friendliness and willingness to be a support. this is what it's about. but, this is not to say that the equipments' condition is not important. it is. i can say that they keep it up really well (the guy who makes repairs is on it...i always see his focus and that nothing stays down for very long). it's not perfect but who and what ever is? so, i would recommend you consider checking this gym out. go right to the manager nathan and you'll see how welcome you really are. he shows it. that's my two cents. paul"
28,i was having issues with fridge water dispenser and called one shot and spoke with gabe. he was extremely helpful and very knowledgable about my issue. he helped locate the cause of the leak and knew where to find the replacement parts it needed. highly recommended for any repairs!!!
29,called for furnace inspection and consultation on potential repair/replacement need prior to selling house. great experience. the technician was on time and very respectful. he took the time to explain everything and answer all my questions thoroughly. didn't push me to buy but gave a good breakdown of potential options and estimates if i decided to replace the unit.
30,i'm a kitchen and bath designer and owner at studio q designs.  i met matt about five years ago.  we have worked together on several small and very large projects.  his attention to detail assist me in providing a high quality finished installation for my clients.  a high-quality finished installation does not only pertain to the finished product but also pertains to the warranty on the installation.  wharton construction and design responds promptly to anything that needs to be repaired.  this is a valued characteristic of a qualified contractor whose concern is with the clients and the finished product.  thank you matt!
31,i called pete for water damage repair after reading great reviews. i am glad i did. my walls look as if nothing ever happened. thank you!!!
32,"i highly recommend robert.  extremely competent, very knowledgeable, very honest. better than all the repair people i have met in 3 (three) states.  very happy experience."
33,"i needed a bedroom window repaired quickly because i had just put my home up for sell and had an offer and inspection happening within days. mark came out the same day i called him and fixed my window in about 30 minutes. not only is mark friendly and professional, his work was excellent and completed at a very reasonable cost. i would highly recommend mark and will call him again the next time i need a repair or remodel."
34,worked with these guys about 10 times over the past few years and found them to be very honest and competent. several times i have misdiagnosed a problem and they have advised me on repairs that cost less or workarounds that they charged nothing for. they do quality and work and finish on time. some of these one star reviews are very unreasonable.
35,"great work.... repair looks good as new - body and paint.  i will use them again and have recommended them to friends.  took a little longer than originally quoted, but they kept me updated and did it right."
36,"we were referred to this company by neighbors.  they painted all the exterior trim on our house which looks great.  we also needed quite a bit of interior drywall repaired and repainted.  their drywall repair was amazing and took only 1-1/2 days.  this company shows up on time, completes the job quickly, and are professional in every respect.  we will gladly recommend them to anyone and will use them for any future painting needs."
37,"when i think of the mgm grand arena... boxing is the first thing that comes to mind. built for the sports venue and built in a way that regardless of your seat location, every seat has a good view. great atmosphere, great crowd. place is a bit older now and might need a small renovation, but its still a cool place!"
38,"it takes a certain kind of man to invite you to his living room to conduct business. rich is an amiable guy, and is honest enough to inform you when a repair may not be necessary, despite his opportunity to profit. i went to him thinking i was going to pay out the wazoo, but mr beck let me know that my guitar would be fine as is. the consultation was free, and i know where i'm going in the future."
39,very good job on the renovation! impressive! nice and bright gaming area with good selection of restaurants. looks alot more customer friendly.
40,"update..doug called me after viewing review and scheduled someone to come out and make things right. my storage cabinets are  whole. i can now give 5 stars. all repairs have been made and they now look brand new. i appreciate doug sending rob, very nice guy and does meticulous work. love the cabinets, very sturdy and very roomy! clutter be gone! thanks doug!"
41,"branden and steve to the rescue! neighbor's garbage disposal was seriously jammed. since she if near deaf, i called on a thursday and batman and robin rolled in on schedule the next morning. prompt (actually 15 min early), patient and very friendly. they were able to repair (not replace) the disposal and fix a broken pipe fitting at a reasonable cost."
42,"had 5 patches repaired on favorite shorts...
excellent seamstress, very nice people, conveinant, economical.... good quality, highly recommend... :-)"
43,"yet another good review for garcia's windows & more. i usually trust yelp till i am proven wrong and i figured the five star reviews couldn't be that out of line. you would never think leaky windows in arizona would be an issue, but then you have never seen the monsoons. the cost of repairs to my leaky window  were very reasonable and they fixed the window quickly all in one visit.  mark is a nice guy and seems to really know what he's talking about.  if you have window issues give him a call.

update:  lots of rain last night and the window is leak free.  so they are good guys."
44,"what a great experience working with don.  his thoroughness and promptness was needed and very much appreciated. not only does he complete the inspection but he spends the quality time explaining the specifics beyond what a report shows. last, his summary report makes it real easy to take the serious findings and work with the seller. also, this was a great experience from the start; his communication from my initial request was prompt and he didn't just say ""visit my website"" like others. thanks don - the seller is paying for all the repairs. highly recommend."
45,"i'm so impressed with william! he spent an hour investigating the cause of my leak and determined, through two messy crawls through insulation in the attic, that the cause was a leaky pipe and not a roof leak at all. even though there were some minor problems noted on the roof, he determined that they are not leaking and so caulked to seal them at no charge and told me i didn't need a roof repair. i wouldn't hesitate to call him again for any roofing needs i have. he is knowledgeable, friendly and honest."
46,"nick came out and repaired our broken sprinkler. he was quick, priced fairly and coordinated with my schedule via text. i would highly recommend and will use again. i use yelp all the time and nick was awesome!!"
47,"their still in the process of finishing the renovation. the seats are now the recliner and they are very comfortable. i normally don't fall asleep in movie theaters, specially if it's an action movie like jason bourne but i did. the only thing is that the movie theater was a bit warm for me. the theater was full, maybe that's the reason, but anyways would be nice if it was a little cooler."
48,"renovations are still underway, but outdoor drapes and curtains give the place a tropical, calssy, jamiaca-meets-south beach feel. the inside of the lounge now features a wooden dance floor, which helps the growing swing scene on fridays."
49,"jeff, stacy and ernesto were amazing! jeff came out to give us a quote, answered all of our questions and was super friendly. stacy was an amazing help with our follow up questions and throughout the whole process. and ernesto did a fantastic job with our house. from the painting to the repairs needed - can't say enough wonderful things! our house was a terrible peach/salmon color before and we changed to a light cream color with the trim and pop outs a slightly darker brown. we chose a satin finish too and he made sure the old color didn't show through anywhere and that everything was neatly done. all three were friendly, helpful and patient (i ask a lot of questions). i highly, highly recommend j&m!"
50,i have rented from bpm 3 times in the past 23 years.  they are the best rental company i have found. honest & prompt with repairs .
51,"sun country is refreshing change from all the scam companies out there. i called them for a second opinion after a bad experience with another company (larson). they came the same day, which was amazing, and they provide second opinions free of charge! yes, free provided you have a written quote from the other company. how amazing is that??

turns out the repair i needed was no where near as urgent or expensive as made out to be larson.  the tech was also super friendly and helpful, unlike other said company. when the time comes, sun country is definitely getting all my business for any repairs or maintenance needed. these guys are great!

thanks, fellow yelpers for recommending this company!"
52,"z best turf repaired a play yard for one of our tenants in a retail center.  rob was helpful, educational, prompt and communicative.  as a property manager over 1,100 miles away, i greatly appreciate competent vendors.  my tenant was happy with the repair and the quick turnaround."
53,needed a refrigerator repaired. the y responded quickly and accomodated my crazy schedule. my technician was professional and offered explanation for the necessary repair.
54,monster air repaired our ac unit very quickly. they estimated between 11 &1 and arrived earlier than expected. our ac is blowing cold air and works great now.
55,"this company was great!  they had someone at my house within in a few hours - even though it wasn't an emergency.  our plumber was bill, and he was fantastic!  he was able to complete my laundry list of repairs and double-checked work we had done by a remodeling contractor, all within the one-hour minimum.  he even checked some items i didn't remember to ask about! he explained everything he did in a way that was informative, professional and friendly.  i would definitely use this company again, and be happy to have bill complete any plumbing work!"
56,called 24/7 at 6:00 am on saturday. they were at our house one hour later. they found out what the issue was within 15 minutes. repaired it in 15 minutes. juan was very friendly and knowledgeable. i will call them again for any electrical issues we have in the future. i would highly recommend them for any electric issues you might have.
57,"i've been here a couple time for repairs to worn, ripped items and they do good work, quick and at a good price!"
58,"i recently had these guys do some work on our new home.  we needed a half bath completely redone as well as some painting and minor repairs.  pete responded quickly.  came out and gave me what i thought was a very fair quote for the work.  he scheduled the work to be completed in 2 days.

when they started working they discovered that a floor that was to be replaced with tile had unexpectedly been glued down.  this slowed them down a bit and caused some extra work for them.  he still finished the work on time and kept to the original quote even with the extra work.  
my wife and i are very happy with the work and guess who we will be calling to work on our old house when we turn it into a rental."
59,"doug schramm at exclusively tankless is a life saver. our 'eternal' tankless water heater started leaking and popped the gfi. i learned that the company had gone out of business a year or so after we installed the unit three years ago. we are in san diego and started hunting for someone locally to repair it. doug at et was the only one i talked to that was knowledgeable on the unit and could help. i sent doug a picture of the leaking part and he knew exactly what it was and how to fix it. he sent me the new part at no charge, i only had to pay $10. for the one day ups shipping. he walked me through the procedure on replacing the part, testing and startup. it was really easy and i fixed it myself with his direction. he probably saved me $2,000.+ for a new unit, which what most of the local guys were quoting me. if i have a problem with the unit in the future, doug will be the first person i call. also, i have several friends in the phoenix area and will definitely recommend et/doug to them.  we've got hot water again, life is good. thanks again doug."
60,"in 30 years for having sprinkler work - both install and repair, in both arizona and california i have never experienced a more professional company.  highly professional, finished on time and the company is a joy to work with.  if you use anyone else, well the best of luck.  this company sets the gold standard in the phoenix metro area."
61,"the 5 star rating cones from the perspective of my 20 years as a customer. i've renewed my contract with 2-10 every february since 1998. its saved my ass every single year. its the single smartest decision i've made as a homeowner. those of you with negative reviews, zoom out a little bit. the hassle isn't coming from 2-10, our houses are the hassle because they're in constant need of repair.  when the ac unit on top of the house gave up the ghost, 2-10 showed up with a crane, removed the old unit, installed the new unit. i slept through the whole process, and when i woke up i had a bill for $75.  of course that's just one example. i've got 19 more years worth of them. i'm no handyman, i'm a smart man that chooses to live in my house, not worry about it.
sincerely, 
gary r."
62,"my ""go to"" spot when i need something repaired in the house, or dreaming of a upgrade i actually can perform myself.  notwithstanding that i believe that i am quite handy myself, they have been able to suggest and on some occasions, teach this old dog new skills in home improvements, which was greatly appreciated."
63,"climate advisers did a fantastic job and the response was immediate.  my two-year-old trane unit went out in this unbearable phoenix heat. he immediately got here, assessed the problem, and begin the repairs... even putting in a temporary replacement while the part we ordered came in the mail. highly recommend."
64,"mike is the man to go to for all your handyman needs. communicating through email, no problem, he is professional, on time and knocks out various jobs quickly providing a good value. he is straightforward and trustworthy, what more could you ask for. highly recommend, contact him now!"
65,"i called in the afternoon because my house wasn't cooling down past 85 degrees on the hottest day of the year, and they sent someone out that evening. the repair man, serge, was very professional and fixed the problem promptly and at a fair price. he even called later that evening to make sure that the house was cooling off. i appreciated his honesty about the condition of my unit and his not pushing a new unit replacement when i told him that we were on a tight budget. the house is still nice and cool today. i highly recommend this company for your heating and cooling needs."
66,"if you are in summerlin or the surrounding area and want an honest, hard working friendly person to handle small jobs around the house for you, daniel is your guy! he fixed lights, repaired walls and even did some electrical work. he is an all around great guy and i would recommend him for anything around the house. small jobs and large ones too. thank you daniel."
67,"this place has gone through some serious renovations lately. i had family in town, so we got rooms downtown, and it is so much nicer than it was just a few years ago. great for being on a budget too."
68,"these guys are the best.  they know the products inside and out, and are kind, informative, and fair in everyway.  take the guess work out of your repair, and let them do what they do best.  i have had many mercedes, and do know them well, but these guys have so much experience, and knowledge, and i could not recommend a more trustworthy source then the great people at mb motors.
you guys rock!!!"
69,"had sylvester and his wife ariana repair our fountain today.
pretty good size fountain at 6 ft. tall.
it was a mess.pump bad.water leaking from inlet and was not
level at all and very dirty.
he returned my call very fast was at our house in a couple hours and on time. yes. same day!
they returned and started to work even with a light rain they did not stop.
pricing was very reasonable and they are just very nice people to work with.
glad i found them on yelp.
to many large companies over charging because of there overhead.
i would give them a 10 star,if i could."
70,pete was super helpful and was honest and upfront about what needed to be repaired. he also went above and beyond and checked out some other stuff for me that i didn't even ask about to let me know what i need to keep an eye on for future reference. so glad i went here!
71,"after their renovation a couple of years ago, this place is awesome! it was pretty good before, but has improved greatly. it's fast, the staff is friendly and chatty, and the pizza is pretty good!  ask for it well-done, and it's even better!"
72,michael did a great job fixing some issues from a home inspection that i had to get repaired prior to closing.  he worked quickly and charged a very reasonable price.
73,"had my house repainted the beginning of july and am very happy with how everything turned out. everything from the initial quote to the actual work was very professional. 
their crew arrived on time and got to work quickly after an exterior walk through with me. they were able to get my 2300 sq. ft. house completed in one day since they had another crew assisting them and also repaired all cracks and stucco damage that i had.  would definitely recommend them to a family member or friend."
74,"called them yesterday after another contractor would not give me an estimate.  they asked for photos of my fountain and defunct pump, sent them, they called within minutes with a quote.  came out this afternoon, on time, had it repaired and working in thirty minutes.  these are the folks to call for fountain repairs."
75,"tru builders- honest, reliable and they do great work. did a renovation in our living room and did exactly what they designed . highly recommend them."
76,i got my smog done and three rock chip repairs in less than 10 minutes not a bad deal...
77,daniel and his team are easy in which to work.  explained product options in a clear manner.  very professional.  also does repairs if needed.
78,"i have been twice--- the family business was warm and inviting.  i had two pieces of jewelry to be repaired and they did it with a smile.  

i am not in the market for big jewelry items but as soon as i need something i will be running right up to them!!  

thanks for the smiles and the help.  

they have beautiful items... ladies :)"
79,"the ago is fantastic. after extensive renovations and an incredible amount of money, the ago has a new look. it's much more modern and interesting (and what better way to execute this than with frank gehry), this will be a wonderful canvas to exhibit their ever-growing collection."
80,very good guys honest on time and got the job done. the  previous handyman  who installed our new water heater did not attach the water softener properly. it leaked to the downstairs unit big headache.  these guys came in and for $100 properly attached the drain fixing the issue. same day. definitely will be calling them for our next job.
81,"i've taken 3 guitars to ash for set ups and fret work and i've always been impressed with his work. he does not need to tell anyone how passionate he is about guitars or his work because his actions and results speak for that.

he'll take as much time as necessary before and after the repair to make sure it's done right and the result is what you want it to be. 100% recommend!"
82,"ted's dogs are the bet.net but they are................closed for renovations until mid-june.
jimmy's dog's for now and they're good, but no ted's!"
83,"i usually go to the postnet on jones but i needed some blueprints printed for a renovation i am doing on my home. my normal postnet couldn't accommodate me so i looked for a different one when i found these guys. they were so awesome and helpful, they did not charge a set up fee and they only charged $1 a page for my blueprint printing. they also informed me that i can just email them the blueprint and they will have it ready for pickup. they are so great and amazing that my love for postnet has grown even greater."
84,"i had a water heater leaked and it was very devastated. had to rip off the walls, base boards, door frames and vinyl. it was an eye sore to look at but j&j came to the rescue. they came and repair every single thing. it was amazing on the work they did; it was like nothing happen. aaaaaaamazing. i would totally recommend them to my friends and family. thank you j&j."

86,"mike, who repaired my thermador refrigerator did an excellent job. not only he was knowledgeable but he was also very personable. well done."
87,"my wife and i our buying our first house and we had don (and his assistant) come out to do the inspection and i was absolutely amazed! he also aligned the termite inspection to happen at the same time. their attention to detail and the 55 page pdf report were incredible! with his report, we were able to show the sellers who agreed to fix all of the ""red items"" as he referred to them! we're talking thousands of dollars in repairs!! would recommend porterhouse to everyone. thanks don!"
88,anytime i need to make any repairs to my home lowe's is where i head  their sales representatives are very knowledgeable in the areas that they work and we'll make sure that you find what you were looking for. i have always had a positive experience.
89,needed to repair and update the security and com system in the home we recently purchased. david and brad were very responsive to our needs.  in addition to repairs they  provided explanations and instructions we needed to understand system we were unfamiliar with.
90,"i had a cracked pane of glass in an old 1950's window. i had contacted another company who came out after i had explained there was a security grate over the window.they not only said they couldn't do it because of that, (when they did know this prior to coming) but they had forgotten putty....wow. so i tried again, looked on yelp and found garcia's windows and more. i emailed them, they contacted me 20 minutes later. i then received a txt and sent pics, they gave me a quote that day. i finalized an appointment with them. they gave me good heads up with time, and arrived when stated. they were very knowledgeable, fast and friendly and answered all my questions. they worked around the security grate and did a fabulous job. i couldn't be happier. i will recommend them to anyone looking for professional, friendly, fast, glass repair. incredibly awesome to deal with in all aspects of initial contact and install!!!!"
91,"a friend referred me to joe's company.  joe was very professional and friendly.  i needed my tile roof to be redone and joe gave me a great quote... much better than other quotes.  joe and his team did a great job.  after the roof instal, there was an issue regarding a leak near our air conditioning unit which was on the roof.  it actually ended up being a drain issue below the rood (in the rafters).  joe immediately took responsibility, fixed the problem and payed for internal repairs.  joe is ""stand up guy"" that you can trust.  thanks for the great job!"
92,i.r.s. is top notch & lance is amazing!!! he was able to move his schedule around and still work within mine. he arrived on time and was very professional. he was able to repair a broken sprinkler valve quickly and at a fare price. lance also alerted me to some small issues that will soon become big problems. needless to say i will definitely be using i.r.s. for my future irrigation needs. a+++
93,"we had arizona cold air replace our 20 year old a/c system at our house. the replacement was done in just a day.  the process is completed using the existing copper lines running into and out of the house.

our lines had a hole which did not show up when checked. arizona cold air was excellent in standing behind their work. after trying to locate the leak for a repair, it was determined that a replacement of the line was the best option. arizona cold air completed the system work and we have been enjoying cool air as well as lower electric bills. thanks arizona cold air."
94,"these guys are great!  they didn't do any work for me but pointed me in the right direction, pete is a tremendous and knowledgable guy who i'm sure will do a great job for anyone who contracts with them.  i will certainly use them next time when i need a handyman.  thanks again pete / call 4 handyman!"
95,"steven knew exactly what he was doing. he came prepared with replacement parts for potential problems and repaired it quickly. he even showed me how to change the light bulb if i ever need to. very professional,  knowledgeable, honest - all at a great price! highly recommend!"
96,"brian and chris in the door department are incredible with their customers! unfortunately, abs, american building supply, is not. in fact, they are horrible. we ordered one of their french doors with sidelights. shortly after installation, the blinds within the glass on one door broke. we could not open them for more light. a job-site inspection by abs was required first to get it repaired. for five months abs gave us and lowe's the big runaround with repeated promises to send someone out. they never did. brian and chris did everything humanly possible to make this happen. do not buy abs products!!! they are not an honorable company and do not honor their warranty. buyers beware!"
97,"this is an excellent company to use if you are in need of awning repair/replacement.  everything they did was very efficient and of high quality.  they scheduled an appointment right away and as soon as they were hired to replace our awnings, they took the old ones down right away.  they were very professional and their followup is excellent.  they kept me posted as to status of the new awnings and got them installed when they said they would.  our new awnings look great and  i highly recommend using all pro awnings!!"
98,"i needed my house painted, but i also needed repairs made, light fixtures and water faucets changed, and i needed the exterior of my house pressure washed.  how excellent to be able to have one company that does it all?  this is a great company to work with.  everyone was hardworking and conscientious and all of the projects were completed on time and budget."
99,"i had an issue with the repair performed here the first time around, but the owner contacted me and offered to fix the problem so i guess i will be returning. i like it when businesses do a follow up with their customers."
100,"i had sylvester and his wife ariana repair my small water fountain.  it needed a pump and they were at my home on friday, investigated the problem and on saturday they installed it.  they are reasonable, prompt and very efficient.  i would recommend them to any of my friends."
101,derrick and jason were very professional and took the time necessary to analyze our situation and properly repair it for which we are thankful.  great work gentlemen.
102,"eric was very thorough and helpful through the inspection process. he even pointed out an additional inspection that saved me from buying a home with $20k+ plumbing repairs. i would trust him to inspect any home i plan on purchasing. he noted even the smallest details that may not be fixed by the seller, but that i would want to handle on my own. you'll finish your inspection with a great idea of what needs to be done."
103,"dan is a miracle worker again! repaired water damage down at the floor level on our wooden eat in table and wood wall next to our built-in frig. thanks, dan!"
104,"hays repaired a leaking vent and replaced the roofing on our porch.  i was very happy with the work and the condition they left the yard in.  the crew was polite and willing to answer my questions.  it was a little challenging getting things scheduled, but i am happy with the price and the quality of work."
105,"a co-worker referred me to beall's to get a competing bid after another contractor orally quoted me a bid of $3,800 to $4,900 depending on how we wanted to fix the problem.  i called beall's and they diagnosed and repaired the problem for the cost of a camera down the line ($215) and $142.23.  

put another way, they saved christmas by saving us more than $3,400.  based on this experience, i am comfortable abandoning my three bid requirement for all home repairs when it comes to plumbing issues and will start and end with a call to beall."
106,we just had a-1 garage repair help us with one of our garage doors. they were awesome!
107,i was referred to evans by my home warranty for a garage opener repair. i was contacted promptly by franklin about the repair and it was handled within a day. dealing with contracted workers for a warranty company can take several days for a response and to be scheduled. the fix was quick and painless on my end. thank you
108,"i have found my new handyman! after reading positive reviews on yelp i called john to see if he was available to take a look at my list of projects. he came out within a day or two of my call and was able to handle everything on my list which included- replacing the fascia on my porch before house painting; rebuilding my brick flower box; fixing my sprinkler system; replacing  kitchen faucets and lots of other small projects. john always came up with the most cost effective way to resolve a problem, arrived on time and completed each task successfully! it's a great relief to know that when i have work to be done, i know someone who knows how to do many things well. he will tell you if there is a job that he isn't comfortable with but he is so versatile i didn't experience that. yay john! i am compiling a new list :)"
109,"jon was professional, informative and punctual. he installed all my light fixtures throughout my home. one of a kind handyman, i highly recommend him! you will not be disappointed."
110,"this place is great! i brought in 6 knives in need of sharpening and repair due to chips and uneven surfaces. 24h and $30 later, it's like i have a whole new set of knives. i am so glad to have found you!"
111,i can't say enough good things about real cool.  they have been maintaining my units since i purchased my home. in 2013 they replaced my heat pump with exactly the professionalism you would expect from a customer centric company. they have yet to disappoint me. every tech has taken the time to explain any issues and not once have i had to clean up after completed repairs. other companies should  take lessons on how to successfully focus on their customers needs.
112,i had a few small things that needed to be repaired before i could sell my house. ozzy got it done so fast! they were professional and cleaned up after themselves. i'd hire them again for sure.
113,"ron came within an hour of our call on a sunday right before independence day. he was both professional and friendly. there was a flat fee rather than an hourly rate, so we appreciated that he took his time over the necessary repair. he complimented my husband's initial repair attempt, and he demonstrated extensive knowledge of an arizonan's plumbing needs. we would definitely recommend robin's plumbing overall and ron in particular for his expert, quality repair work."
114,"done.  found my new local repair people.
straight-shooting and attentive --- even when they were wicked busy."
115,"this company is fantastic. i had a small tear in an outdoor cushion. i took it in, expecting to have to leave it. they repaired it on the spot in less than five minutes and the price was unbelievable! i recommend this company highly."
116,mike was everything i was looking for in a handyman. he arrived on time and was courteous. i gave him my list of projects and he knocked them out in just a couple hours. i wouldn't hesitate to call him in the future and would definitely refer him to friends.
117,i had problems with my a/c all summer.  i had brad the handyman out and he couldn't fix it. then precision from chandler who changed a capacitor and still my a/c lines were freezing up.  on my 4th call i tried accutemp.  mike came out and determined i had a clog in the expansion value.  he cleaned it up and the a/c has been running great since.  i would definitely use this company again.
118,"i called this morning and they were able to come out this afternoon.  we had purchased a replacement garbage disposer, but they were able to clean out and get the old one working again so we will be returning our new garbage disposer. the price was right, the work was done well and they even took the time to show us what they were doing so we could try to fix it ourselves next time using the wrench they gave us.  will definitely call them next time we need a handyman!"

aquaseal  (pierre and his team) were great. they gave a reasonable quote and date to do the job. they showed up on time and completed the job within hours. while the job was in process pierre explained what they were doing and why.
great job! they cleaned up the site and other than the repair you would never know they were here. review c/o masha
my mind is at rest knowing that i no longer have to worry about my leaky basement.
thank you aquaseal and pierre.review c/o masha"
120,"very responsive and accommodating on schedule as we were in a hurry. prompt, efficient and excellent quality work. an added bonus, he provided great recommendations on cost saving measures that we could take. pete will be our go to guy on any needed household repairs!"
121,"i just wanted to thank ben aguilar for doing such a great job at my moms house, we had quite a bit of work that needed to be done and ben was very professional and also friendly, he did great work and i would definitely use ben again for future repairs. thanks again ben!!

122,"based on the other ratings, i spoke with don, the owner.  he talked me through trying a few things and when i opened and re-closed the dishwasher, it started to run.  i will monitor the unit to make sure it continues to run and will call don again, should it need a more thorough investigation and repair.

he also provided ideas of what may be causing the issue and an approximate estimate should one type of repair be needed.

thank you."
123,nice little place.  great renovations made here! very much improved! i like that there's a nice patio area outside with a fire and corn hole and a good beer selection on the inside.
124,peter helped us with our recent home renovation in high park. we had a great experience working with him as he listened well and had many good ideas. he was open to whatever changes we wanted and helped not only with paratical accessiores (like bathroom fixtures) but also with design elements that flowed through the whole house. in choosing elements he assessed our style and brought three chooses which made the process much easier. overall great experience and would high recommend him!!
125,"to sum it up, amazing. they pressure washed the house. repaired the stucco as needed. treated the wood around the roof line and applied a sealer around the foundation. only took the crew 2 days to complete the work. fast, efficient, and clean!"
126,"recent renovation and this is the spot! i used to be a regular and quit due to some oddball trainers. i returned recently when i was short on time and needed a closer gym and i was blown away. this was already a newer facility, but the face lift was awesome. i will definitely pop by more often."
127,"i had called nick after a poor experience with another company in need of an irrigation system tune up. i had bad valves, sprinkler heads, nozzles, and leaks... you name it, my system needed attention for it. nick showed up right on time and finished the job ahead of schedule and did great work. among others, one of the major problems i had with the first sprinkler repair company i had talked to was that i just couldn't trust them. with nick, i got honest answers and i was able to trust him and associate alan. good, hard working guys. i'll definitely use nick for all my irrigation system repair needs in the future."
128,these guys are great.... i have a lowered bmw and no one will touch it due to it being so low and these guys don't even give a second thought! they are respectable every time you call and every time you go in they get you in and out depending on the repair! recommend these guys with six stars if i could!
129,"mike was super helpful, quick, efficient, and i would definitely use him again. he even had some suggestions for future repairs which he sent me a quote for, but was very low pressure about it. his rate is very reasonable, and his manner is friendly. i couldn't be happier with this company!"
130,"after 5 years my lg fridge compressor died.  i notified rc willey about my warranty and was referred to buy-rite.  we had to wait about a week to get an initial inspection to confirm the compressor problem.  we then had to wait 5 days to get it installed because they had to order the compressor.  i didn't get the tech's name that installed the compressor but they came within the time window they gave me.  he was professional with the installation, took the time to blow out the dust and was done within an hour.  the replaced compressor was a lot quieter than the first.  my only concern was the amount of time that we had to wait until everything was repaired, other than that we had a good experience with buy-rite."
131,"the national golf academy (better known as the golf dome), located behind the alberta boot company right on the c-train line on 50th ave se, is a fine place to hone your golf game.  the cavernous indoor facility boasts a 2-tiered driving range with 33 hitting areas and costs 45 cents per minute, or $13.45 per half hour - i recommend rapid fire to get more bang for your buck!  not the cheapest i've encountered in calgary, but if you're not up to braving the elements, it's a viable option to keep your game in tiptop shape year round.  if you're game is in a state of disrepair, not to worry, as the national golf academy features a roster of nine professional instructors that offer golf lessons to all ages and skill levels.  we all know the weather in calgary to be unpredictable, so it's nice to know that, regardless of the conditions, the nga has got us golfers covered."
132,"awesome, helpful, friendly, work done right, thoughtfully considered our budget in repair needs.  steve is solid."
133,"my heater went out, and i was in dire need of a technician. i requested a quote through yelp, and i received a response within 24 hours. the technician quickly made a prognosis and, within the week, he arrived and made the repair. he even gave me tips on how to do small maintenance so i can get the most out of my unit.

i recommend excellence air for all your hvac needs, especially if it's an emergency; they're quick, friendly, and just excellent!"
134,"lonnie and josh know what they are doing, excellent work and professionalism. they are affordable and knowledgable. if u need work done have umm check it out they tell you what is needed before they begin the work. i will be a repeat customer if my repairs exceed what i can or want to do. thanks guys!!"
135,dr anderson is an amazing surgeon and vet. i highly recommend him. he repaired two acl's for us in 2015 and one hip and all three dogs are doing beautiful!! he has a lot of experience and we are lucky to have him in the valley !
136,"today jesus a. came to fix my water heater and garbage disposal. i am extremely satisfied!
jesus showed up in appointed time frame, was very polite and professional. he finished the job in 10 minutes and gave me necessary instructions how to avoid repairs in future. thank you very much!"
137,"seriously.  these guys are the best!  fast, efficient and friendly.  they really take pride in their work and it shows.  they only allow the best plumbers to represent them, and arm them with the best equipment.  
brian was at my door within 2 hours of our call. unlike the guy from the home warranty that took a week to show up only admit failure after half an hour.  of course he (home warranty guy) recommended more expensive repairs.  brian had the whole issue fixed in under ten minutes. 
next time i will call robin's first and you should too."
138,nick is a true professional!  i had suspected some mold in a rental property of mine.  he came out and did a mold test and sure enough there was mold.  what could have been a huge repair turned out to be something small.  i'm glad nick was able to come out quick and help me out.
139,first time calling this company for garage door repair.  impressed!  they responded within two hours.  took the time to do the job right.  i highly recommend this company for your garage door issues.
140,i used these guys recently to repair small hole in a bathtub. their employee was polite and did a great job. happy customer.
141,"absolutely exceptional work from start to finish! the level of detail involved was extraordinary, and everyone we came in contact with was incredibly professional and just a joy to work with. the crew was courteous, and did an amazing job at keeping us informed and asking for our approval before doing anything. the job itself was done in an extremely timely manner, and looks fantastic! they repaired a lot of stucco on our accent structures, and now you can't even tell there was any damage! we would recommend cor to anyone looking to repaint their house."
142,brian was on time and professional. he cleaned my dryer vent and found 3-4 blockages in it.  he believed it probably had never been cleaned in 40 years. he also found a problem with my dryer's output vent.  this will be helpful if i decide to have it repaired. i recommend him to everyone.  get your dryer vent cleaned out no fewer than once every 5 years!
143,"my house is finally cool. i had 4 different companies that either claimed they couldn't fix my unit and/or wanted to rip me off. this was the first company that gave me options for repair or replace. as well, they gave me options for replacement instead of trying to sell me the most expensive unit out there as the other companies did. i consulted with scott bird on a new unit. he was very professional and more importantly very honest. when my unit was replaced the guys covered my stone and wood floors before they started their work. after the unit was installed i couldn't even tell they had been in my home. thanks howard air."
144,"just a quick props to the best 24 hr in vegas. staff is so friendly. gym is very clean especially the steam and sauna areas which other 24 hrs seem to have a problem keeping clean and /or in working condition. broken equipment almost never happens and if so its repaired quickly

thanks to all staff"
145,"great company to work with! called them for some problem with my front drip system. showed up when they said they would. assed the problem and were done in an hour. very professional and cleaned up after themselves. this was the second time i've used them, first was a couple of years ago. called about lawn sprinkler came out while i was at work, repaired problem and sent them check. honest company. i didn't know but they do way more than just sprinkler repair."
146,"a/c unit went out on a sunday evening, contacted climate advisors and tim showed up quickly the same day.  work quality was top notch,  friendly and explained the problem and repair process thoroughly.  i highly recommend this company,  they are setting the industry standard bar very high."
147,we had a shower door in our master bathroom that would not stay shut. it was also making a really horrible noise when you opened and closed it because the door was not fitted properly when installed originally. we called handyman solutions in las vegas and they showed up within about three hours on the same day we called. edward was the handyman who arrived and he was very pleasant. he was immediately able to detect what was wrong with the shower door and proceeded to fix it within about 30 minutes of being here. i recommend las vegas handyman solutions for any of your household handyman needs.
148,"kody was my rep and he did an excellent job. the estimate was right on point to the $. no games, no surprises. the repair took just as long as he said it would and i was able to pick up my audi without a problem. i would recommend these guys to anyone."
149,"renovations are great! easy to navigate, cool restaurants."
150,long story short i was doing my kitchen renovation got a very bad electrician put holes in my wall demolish my electric and even fell through my ceiling. i call dave's they went above and beyond for me i was on a time crunch and they came out that day they had a full schedule dave fit me in they got my kitchen done..they were very professional they went above and beyond anything i could ever expect or ask for..if you're looking for an electrician i would say dave's they are fantastic very professional just everything was just excellent i would recommend them a 110%. thanks dave's
151,"ozzy installed electrical outlets and finished with drywall repair.  he arrived early, was thorough with his work and his clean up was fantastic.  we will definitely call him again when we have more projects.  highly recommended!"
152,i was trying to by a house and my credit was to low to qualify. rondi and his team at fortress credit pro repaired my credit and brought my score up over 200 points in less than 60 days. my wife and i were able to buy our home and at a very good interest rate. rondi and fortress credit pro know thier stuff and the laws that follow.
153,"robert is a god sent! on 4 july 17 at 1100pm my garage literally fell apart as i attempted to close it so i immediately called the listed number on the broken garage and received an appointment the very next day! robert was very prompt and professional. he lowered my anxiety and gave me his honest expert opinion and also gave me various options for the solution to my problem. after we work out my best option, robert quickly went to work and repaired my garage in under an hour. i'm so happy with the outcome and i will definitely use sun city garage if my garage as issue in the future!  thank you so much robert you are awesome!"
154,i was referred to noriega masonry by home advisor and i am very happy.  jesse came out to estimate last week and it did take a few days to get on the schedule but the team showed up on time and did very quick work to replace a 17 foot section of wall and repair 6 other large cracks. the team was very good at communicating what they were doing and cleaned up everything quickly. all done within 4 hours and i would highly recommend.
155,"i called them yesterday to get an estimate to replace a broken piece of glass on my leaded glass window. they were able to give me a very reasonable estimate just from pictures that i emailed to them. then, they were able to come out today (the very next day) to fix the window. the guy was on time, friendly, and professional. he was able to fix the window and clean up in about an hour. 

i would highly recommend them for stained or leaded glass window repairs!"
156,"i'm not a handyman by any stretch and every time i need someone to come out and do something with the house, it seems there's always something a bit shady or odd with whats going on.  that is definitely not the case with mike c from benjamin franklin plumbing.  it's apparent he really knows his stuff and is very great at explaining things to me so that i understand.  overall he just seems like a very honest guy who's opinion i trust."
157,"shoots from the hip, does good work, and follows up. all you could ask for in ac repair!"
158,"i came down to our vacation home to relax for a couple weeks ,come to find out my ac was out i called and within an hour the technian arrived.he found the problem quickly ,he repaired our unit and walked me threw the repair the whole time what a great experience! i will continue to use this company they are very knowledgeable and very affordable thank you!!! thank you for making my vacation just what i came for comfortable and relaxing thanks bartosh."
159,"my husband and i were on the brink of divorce and surprisingly he suggested marriage counseling. i was doubtful and didn't really like the idea until i ran across her on yelp. we've done counseling in the past with another counselor and while it helped him understand what i was feeling, i didn't feel like it resolved anything for me. sure enough we were fighting again and it got to the point where we did not want to talk and were emotionally and physically distant with each other. jane has helped us understand each other and learn to communicate with each other and solve our conflicts with one another. i am now hopeful that our marriage can be repaired. i'm so happy we found jane! we drive about 50 minutes just to see her and she is definitely worth the drive!"
160,we hired las vegas handyman solutions to do some cable pulling for a camera system at our parents house.  wow!!  were we impressed by the professionalism david displayed when handling the job.  we will definitely be calling in the future with any projects we might need.
161,it's a bridge. it's in better shape than the bridge that is closed to pedestrians for repairs.
162,"they quickly diagnosed my issue, charged me a reasonable rate,  didn't pressure me into unnecessary repairs and completed the work fast.  they are a find.  i highly recommend them."
163,scott has been my go to guy since the late 90's.  very knowledgeable about the subtle and often times not so subtle nuances that come with plumbing in older homes.  i have never called him twice for the same repair.  once it's fixed the parts will wear out from use before you will need him again for that part or system.  this most recent repair was for a broken tub faucet.
164,"great drywall repair, showed up on time and did the work as promised. very happy with the results and the work performed. will use them again if we need to, very courteous and professional."
165,i highly recommend this company. i called and they said they could come out the following morning. the repairman arrived very promptly and went right to work. luckily he was able to repair my ancient wall oven right in the spot. works great now. he was very friendly and the fee was most reasonable. i will be using them again in the future.
166,"i found a cool pipe with the hammer and sickle on the side, unfortunatley it came with a free piece of metal jammed hard into the stem.

i took it to thomas hinds and the buddies there while understandably looking at me like ""what the fuck did you do to this pipe?"", immediately took out their  tool kit and tried to fix it, for free. as i expected the pipe was too far gone and after about 5 minutes of delicate work, the mouthpiece broke and the guy apologized. this was my last resort and i figured it would happen anyways, they hooked me up with a pipe repairman in quebec (there are none in toronto, or ontario for that matter) giving me all his contact info.

i didn't even buy anything. but i sure will when that pipe is all fixed up.

these guys are awesome."
167,"i had in-ceiling surround speakers and a kitchen cabinet repair i needed done in a hurry.  mark gave me a good quote and lucky me had an opening next day.  he was very honest,  professional, and friendly.  did an amazing job.  he also guarantees his work.  would recommend if you need anything done."
168,best 's around. went every week as a kid. great town staple. haven't been in a while but did drop in after the renovations and rebuild. can't eat them anymore but if i could i would get my donuts here.
169,"he came to install a door for our two pups. he was very friendly and professional, and his work was amazing! we had to reschedule our original appointment due to some unforeseen circumstances and he worked with our schedule. the cuts were very neat and he saved the material for an easy repair in the future. highly recommend!"
170,no fuss no muss. gave them a call they were able to come the next day. my wheels were repaired perfectly for  a reasonable charge. highly recommended.
171,"truly if you want to be protected by having the best home inspector on your side then hire red beard inspections llc. jed is very detail oriented and saved me money on costly repairs if they were not found.
i would highly recommend to redbeard inspections llc"
172,"if i could give them 10 stars i would!!!  what a phenomenal experience. we got our quote which was by far the most reasonable price over other bids and it included a lot of extras that the other companies didn't have in their bids like 50' of major stucco repair. the crew arrived on time and got to work. they repaired all of the major stucco damage with a special product the manager brought after the crew leader told him we needed something other than the normal stucco product. the job took a few extra days and they still stuck to their original bid and didn't charge us more!!!  now that's integrity!  plus they said they will honor the 3 year warranty if any cracks reappear!  to top it off one of the other painting companies who had bid the job stopped by to say what an amazing job and asked who did it. i was very proud to tell them arizona painting company did it and saved me $19,000 over their bid!!!  thank you to the crew and brian cho, production manager for going above and beyond!  if you are thinking of having your house painted don't even think about calling anyone else!!!!!"
173,"the fajitas are always good, but the place seriously need a renovation.. it still looks the same from when i was kid.. lol .. they also need more beers on tap cuz this 3 beer selection just doesn't cut it. other than that i would recommended this place to anyone anytime."
174,"nick is the guy to call for drip and sprinkler repairs. he is reliable, efficient and friendly. he will clearly communicate and show you all of the     repairs that he makes and his pricing is very reasonable. thanks for a job well done nick!"
175,"this theatre is the one we go ( even if there's one closer in our own city) and we didn't find one better so far.  
it actually get old slowly so i can imagine soon one will be better or they should do some renovation. 

never have been desapointed so far .  i recommend"
176,they were very helpful and pointed me in the best direction for my repair .
177,"we have used all valley electric about five times. we've used them to hang fans, installing lighting and repair electric box. they have always done great work and are very friendly and timely.  i couldn't be happier!  give them a try."
178,"jake at stone family did a phenomenal job fixing up the landscaping for my rental house. the tenants left it in total disrepair and he made suggestions on a relatively quick, but good bang for my buck to get it ready to sell. he promptly responded to my commutations and delivered exactly what he proposed. i highly recommend them."
179,been going here for years.. best pizza in the burgh.. the place just underwent a massive renovation that looks beautiful and blows mineos out of the water! you won't regret coming here.. they put a bar in and also have tons of beers and sodas to choose from
180,just repaired our deck did a very professional and quick job. very knowledgeable employee and very friendly would use again
181,"nick and raul came out to repair the heater.  they were sent by my home warranty plan.  they were very professional, on time and courteous.  they changed the thermostat which another company had put in that never worked.  i would definitely use this company again!"
182,"i like to support small businesses, and this business is a phenomenal example of why i do.  the business owner, wayne, came out to fix our garage door after a different company failed to fix it.  wayne fixed it, and i won't even go into how great a deal money-wise it was.  it was a great deal!

if we ever need our garage door or garage door opener fixed or repaired again, this is our company.  he is the type that does way more than necessary to help his customers.  look no further, this is the company you should choose if you live anywhere near the east valley in arizona."
183,"i didn't end up going with gabriel for this repair because of pricing, but he was very professional and went above and beyond in communication with me. he responded almost immediately on yelp, consistently responded to messages and communication quickly, and was able to provide me a rough quote within the day.

if you have an immediate situation or emergency that needs resolving, i would recommend contacting him as you are more likely to get your situation resolved faster than any other company."
184,"honestly, i wish every purchase i've made was as pleasurable as this one. you can book an appointment online through their website (thank you for the much desired convenience!) and diane will be contacting you with any additional questions. i'm a first time home buyer and she helped me realize i didn't need some of the inspections i ordered. got that portion of the cost refunded immediately! jason was thorough in his inspection and explained everything to me, which i used to have the seller pay for a few minor repairs. couldn't recommend them enough!"
185,this circle k recently had a renovation to the exterior. it didn't use to have pumps but now it has a few (maybe 7?). which is great! they should have added more than 7 pumps because it's always so busy and in the heart of old town scottsdale where there aren't many gas stations. the inside is clean and even has a wine section.
186,"i sell real estate here in the las vegas valley and i use jeremie eubank, and his crew, at a step above roofing for all of the roof repairs that are are needed as a result of an home inspection. they perform at an outstanding level and take pictures of the repairs that are needed and pictures after the repairs are complete so you can rest assured that the work was done. call them..... you'll see!"
187,update: can give a higher review now because they went through a renovation so now everything's clean and nice! also open on time

190,"my 62 vette needed the speedometer repaired.  i had taken it to the original dicks on 7th street and the along with the gage cluster and it set there for 3 months.  this is not the same owner (although these guys said they used to work at the original one years ago.)  the gages and speedometer were fixed and calibrated in just over 24 hours.  the price was very fair, about $225."
191,"this was an awesome experience from start to finish!!! gabe was professional, courteous and efficient! not only was he able to come out the day after i called but he showed up on time! he helped me to understand why the washer was not draining as well as how to use it more efficiently. i will defiantly use one shot installation for any washer/dryer repairs or electrical help."
192,"this company has been around since the 1950's and it's easy to see why. they are good guys, who are honest and stand by their work. won't hesitate to call again if we need any plumbing repairs. i'd rather support local businesses than the big corporations anyway!"

203,"best garage door company in town, bar none! 
always on time. always friendly. they know their business and they get it done quickly and efficiently. this time the door broke right before a major holiday and they still managed to fit me in, last minutes notice on a saturday. they showed up on the early side of the timeframe as well so i didn't spend one of my only days off waiting for a repair. the tech even threw in a free light cover as he noticed mine was broken and he took one off a job the day before. need i say more?! highly recommend you call this company first should the need arise."
204,the very best heating and ac company i have ever used. they are always prompt with their appointment. thorough with their inspection. explains problems if there are any so you understand if part or repair is necessary. very affordable. and their crew is friendly and professional.
205,"first, i love that this company communicates via email. i sent dozens of requests for quotes via email and only received a few responses. fabulous floors was able to stop by and give me a quote quickly and schedule to repair my damaged floors within my desired timeline. when they arrived to repair and stain my floors, i had an idea of what color stain i wanted. the employee offered his expert advice and i am very glad that i took it. the floors look great with the lighter stain. it is also worth mentioning that the price did not change. nothing popped up along the way and the price i was quoted before the work started was the price i paid when it was finished."
206,"i have used dan three times to repair my furniture, most recent was my restoration hardware coffee table and it looks flawless. don't use anyone else, dan is a master!"
207,"i have had repairs made to refrigerators,  washers, and dryers and bought used dryers for my parents and my house. always prompt, friendly, and a great value. i have never had a problem with any repairs or purchases. i would highly recommend them!"
208,i misunderstood the pricing structure for the repair of my vacuum and ended up spending more than i planned. it wasn't corey's fault that i misunderstood- but he still stood behind his business and offered me a more than fair solution. he went over and above what was necessary and i am grateful. i would highly recommend this business.
209,michael is the best home maintenance person i have ever met and i have worked with many. quite frankly he goes the extra mile to ensure the job is done on perfectly every time and his prices are very reasonable. hire mike for your home repair needs and you will not be disapointed.
210,i have always had good experiences with them. always prompt response times and follow ups as well. repairs were done in a timely fashion.
211,this the best and most proficient handyman that i have ever used. he has installed lights and made various repairs around my house 3 times this year. he is the only one that i would consider to do these things for me since the first time he did a great job and every other time he did too. he gets the job done and quickly and and economically and would trust him with almost any repair around my house. my house is pretty well the way i want it after living in it for 30 years in phoenix. call him and schedule him and you will not be disappointed.

214,"bbs accredited since 2003! great place with reasonable pricing. the labor they charged me at $80/hr which seemed fair, they explained what was wrong with the van and walked me through the repairs that were needed.  got a transmission rebuilt with an after market transmission cooler added on to help out with my stop and go driving. they also paid for the tow to get it to them which came out to being about $70 savings.

i highly recommend this place. i will return to have a followup check."
215,"needed to do repairs and adjustments to 15 year old railings and balusters.

called brian, the owner, he stopped by to give me a quote and came out the next day (sunday) to do the work.  tightened everything down, glued, stained and shimmed where needed.  overall an excellent job for a fair price.  brain assured me that his work has a lifetime warranty and if anything needed attention in the future he would happily make it perfect at no cost.

btw, while he was working a buddy came over and introduced me to a general contractor who is his friend.  the contractor looks at brian and says, ""brian is working on your stairs?  he does all my work too.""  that tells me he's in the trades, doing good work.

i would not hesitate to use him for repairs or to design/build your stairs or cabinetry.  he does outdoor deck and patio work also."
216,"in need of a handyman, i contacted call 4 handyman due to the reviews on yelp.  i called, and scheduled a time with pete.  he showed up on time, as well as texted to confirm our appointment.  i had a list of items that needed attention.  pete took the list, and before i knew it, he had fixed everything that could be fixed with tools he had on hand.  a few items on my list needed parts which were ordered.....pete also took the time to try and have a paint color match for paint that was 10 years old and out of stock.  we discussed a new water filtration system for my home, and pete sent me several options.  i decided to have him replace my water system.  on his 2nd trip, he had the parts that were on order as well as installed the new water filtration system.
very efficient, timely and cost appropriate !!!"

219,"out of all the people i've hired so far in our townhome update, i think bill has probably been the best. the drywall in our bathroom looks great and the texture matches very well. the kicker is that bill was extremely quick and his rate was super reasonable. i regret even wasting time thinking about doing the repairs myself."
220,"after having a terrible experience with a different repair company, calling hillside was the best decision. i called this morning at 9:20am and they had someone out by 1:00pm. very happy with how quickly and efficiently everything was done. i got consistent calls from oleg the technician which was very nice as i was not there to ensure everything was done. thank you!"
221,"reliable, gets the job done! 
my go to for handyman or last minute jobs needing asap! he even came out on christmas eve!"
222,"sergey was very courteous, competent and conscientious in his repair. he showed up early, quickly diagnosed the a/c problem and fixed it. he also took the time to measure the results and added a half pound of freon which dropped the output temperature over 10 degrees. i would highly recommend him to anyone who wanted an honest and high quality technician for their air conditioning. he will fix the problem with minimum cost and not try to upsell you resulting in unnecessary expenses."
223,richard was great to work with.  he was prompt and professional.  the job was just as he quoted.  i love my new sink.  he went above and beyond to make sure the work he did was excellent.  i will be calling him for any future countertop and sink repairs.   great company.
224,incredible collection. remarkable temporary installations. gorgeous and bright building following the renovation. very accessible. my family likes to do frequent short visits learning a little bit at a time.
225,my a/c stopped cooling without warning.  one call to canyon state and they had someone out within the hour. turned out to be a capacitor switch that failed--a minor repair that gabe completed in about 15 minutes for a very reasonable price.
226,best place for a wide variety of lighting. special orders also offered. had been looking for new fixtures for a recently remodeled kitchen. frustrated with the national retailers which offered a fairly consistent cheap look. staff assisted me with awesome under cabinet lighting as well as pendants over the new island. also added a new hanging fixture over a diving area. visitors have all asked where i found these unique pieces. also learned they repair broken lamps on site...hard to find these days. these people are awesome and their products provided the bling to my kitchen renovation.
227,"tony, was kind enough to agree to negotiate a settlement on a future repair to make me satisfied with the previous component failure.  they try to do everything to make it right."
228,"great place. honest! and also let's you know of any future repairs that might be needed. i had a tail light out that i was too lazy to fix. i didn't even mention it to them, and they fixed it along w my repairs. they are also pretty quick. takes no longer than 3 hrs for most repairs. i'd recommend to anyone n phx"
229,so happy they reopened from their renovation. my husband and i have been craving their chili cheese dog and corn dogs. the best part is none of their recipes have changed. they currently have some ikea furniture until they get booths said a worker. some of the finishing touches were done messy. as a designer i notice those small details. over all the best hotdogs!
230,"i contacted evans for a free estimate.  the owner came out, on time, and quoted me less than $150 to repair my door, i allowed the work and at completion the bill came in under the quote.  he was fast, efficient and personable.  i will recommend him to anyone needing a repair or replacement!"
231,"grant and his crew did a great job. we had all new construction windows installed in our house so needed stucco repair done around all of them-25 windows total. they were able to start right away after providing a quote, showed up on time when they said they would and finished on time. work looks great. hard working guys who will do the job right."
232,"wow!!! jeremie and his team are outstanding! had to replace a few missing tiles and compared several roof repair companies before going with a step above and am really glad that i did. jeremie came out on time to provide a free estimate which was extremely reasonable.  afterwards, jay and jorge did the repairs. they were on time, efficient and had great attitudes. if you are in need of roof repairs...call a step above first."

234,"best repair man ever!  honest about what is worth fixing and what is too expensive to bother with.  great at helping find the least expensive way to repair anything.  helped me greatly with my subzero, and we all know not many people out there will help you with that brand without mortgaging the house.    you won't be disappointed.  call them. have used several times as i have an ongoing problem with the sub zero refridge."
235,"i've been leasing a house from this company for just about a year...i haven't had any problems w then and fully expect to see my security deposits again. i'm sure those that have had issues just need to document their move in /move out. otherwise, they have responded to questions and repairs timely and fairly."
236,i just had the best experience ever with kevin the technician who came by for s repair. kevin was very friendly and knowledgeable about his work. thank you kevin for your kindness and expertise. i would highly recommend this company to you
237,i can't believe how quickly these guys came over and fixed my annoying squeaky dryer.  it's working better than ever! thanks again for the fast response and doing it right the first time! i highly recommend these guys for dryer repair..5 stars all day!!!!!
238,this company is great!! i contacted adis regarding my kitchen and living room floors; they needed concrete grinding. this was due to cracks found in my foundation; making the floors uneven for my new tile to go down. adis had someone out the next day and did a great job!! the cost was extremely reasonable and i was still able to have my contractor start the work to tile my floors the same day!!! this company will effectively meet your needs.  they were a lifesaver as it regards to my home renovation!!!
239,i've just had a wonderful experience using homelife.  as a new policy holder i wasn't sure exactly what to expect when submitting my first claim.  i was pleasantly surprised how easy it was.  i found the staff very helpful and knowledgeable.  the repairs needed were covered under my policy and the turn around for repairs were quick and professional.
240,done right roofing repaired my roof before i moved in a month and a half ago. i walked out a few days ago and one of the tiles had fallen off and shattered. so thankful they came out and repaired it with few questions asked and free of charge to honor the name done right roofing!
241,"well, i luckily didn't have the same experience as the other reviewer. my vacuum quit on me, i called hoover, they told me what the problem most likely was, and told me strongsville vacuum as a place to take it. 
the guy said it would be two weeks, they called me several days later and said it was fixed and recommended a few other repairs (new filter, a new belt) for $47 my two year old vacuum is like new again. yay!"
242,"i had a problem with my water heater in the middle of the night. i requested a quote on a repair at 8 pm and dave answered right away. he came the next day, diagnosed the problem, checked the other water heater and gave me all the options. he was honest and didn't push anything on us. i decided to get two new units installed with a recirculating pump. i didn't even know what a recirculation lump does!! he stayed all day and fixed it same day. he is a lifesaver. taught me everything about my new system. i could not be happier. he has a customer for life. i have a few other properties i might have him come over and inspect soon. thanks for everything. don't hesitate to call them. great honest and hardworking company."
243,"this was my third interaction with sure temp and each time, they've been great. very responsive, reasonably priced and most importantly, they've earned my trust. no selling pressure, good advice and they talk through the issue completely. i've got a couple of 16 year old units and they honestly discuss the cost benefits of repair vs. replace without ridiculous mark up on parts to make replacing the units the obvious option when it doesn't need to be. this is a field with a lot bad players in it but there are some good ones out there. keith is definitely one of the good ones and runs his business the right way. i highly recommend them."
244,beyer was the contractor for repair of our dishwasher through our home warranty.  the person who called to schedule the repair was friendly and we were able to get on the schedule for the very next day.  r.j. was our tech and he arrived on time.  he quickly diagnosed the problem and was able to make the repair that day.  rj was friendly and very helpful.
245,"honest company, have used them to repair garage doors amd replace a garage door opener at several properties."
246,javier is great. he was honest with me about suggested repairs i needed now and needed later. i will suggest this place to anyone that asks.
247,very good company.....tech serg was coming to my house and repair for 10 min......i'm really recommend this company
248,"i normally get an annual a/c tuneup in may or june with a company i've used for years. this time, i decided to try sun country, based on raves from neighbors in my subdivision. all went well, no repairs needed. however, the tech did show me how the outdoor unit had accumulated dried mud inside. instead of hosing down the unit, which my other company had always done, sun country actually vacuums, thereby getting out much more gunk from the unit than a water hose would do. good to know. these guys really know what they're doing. i'll definitely call them again in future."
249,"a few days ago, on a saturday afternoon, we noticed a drip coming from our living room ceiling.  after doing a google search, my husband and i determined it was most likely coming from an overflowing drain pan from the air handler in the attic.  we contacted our home warranty company, and we we received a call from air standards on monday to set up an appointment today. mark, the technician, called us about 15 minutes before he arrived.  really appreciate that.  it was indeed determined that the drain pipe from the air handler was clogged, and, per mark, this is a very common problem in az at this time of year.  he was able to clear the clog and had the primary drain from the air handler dripping again in no time.  mark answered all of my questions and was a pleasure to do business with.  would highly recommend this company for your air-conditioning repair needs!"
250,"brought in a toyota with damage to the muffler, exhaust tip and pipe, in four hours the pipe and exhaust tip are repaired and the muffler had no damage as i had thought. wow. honest, fast, economical and it looks brand new. 

should have reviewed a couple of years ago because performance muffler installed a flowmaster exhaust on my 2007 tundra and i'm really happy with that, even five years later. can't recommend enough."
251,"my washer broke down sunday night with a load of towels in it :( i  emailed these guys on monday for a quote along with a few others.  within 5 minutes of sending the email, i got a call from breanne to tell me the charge for coming out an assessing the repair and that the tech could come on tuesday.  louis showed up exactly on time. he was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.  found the problem, had the part in the van, fixed and out in 40 mins!  the assessment charge rolled into the repair and labour. all in all a very good experience!  (the other company i emailed still hasn't replied......) i will use this company from now on."
252,"this company was referred to us by our hw company. they were able to come the next day to fix our refrigerator. other companies were 5-7 days out. rj diagnosed the problem, ordered the part and was able to repair the next day! we will use them again, even if our hw company doesn't cover it."
253,home warranty company uses them therefore so do we. fixed a faucet fast. no problems and the repair man was excellent to do deal with.
254,dan repaired my kitchen desk countertop and some furniture pieces. everything looks like new. i highly recommend him!

256,"i have been using this company for the last ten years to repair or replace my air. call them early am, fixed problem with in a hour. would highly recommend them."
257,very fast response with repairs done quickly. nick is very much a customer focused business with a walk through to show there were no residual issues.  a real pleasure to deal with a business person like this.
258,"this place is great!! lots of guitars to choose from! they also have repairs and lessons!! 

great prices!! you can definitely find what you are looking for!!"
259,can't say enough good things about the business. the repair man came out and my dryer was fixed within fifteen minutes! awesome!
260,"this is probably the most amazing thing that has happened. 

selling your house is stressful enough, and on top of that somehow the master bedroom window broke. i called crystal clear view glass and received a super affordable estimate. we paid the estimate and sent the buyer the invoice. unfortunately, the buyer is going through a va loan and wouldn't close until the window was fixed and now we're past the closing date. the owner hears we could be in breach of contract and puts an absolute rush on the window. on his own day off, he gets the window from the supplier and fixes it himself the very next day!! he calls me and tells me the job is complete, and i didn't even know he was at the old house. what an amazing surprise! i was completely speechless. definitely don't go anywhere else for window repair, you'll be making a huge mistake. 

thank you so much brandon and crew!!"
261,"i own many rental properties and have dealt with many vendors for repairs. so many horrible dishonest repair people here in las vegas.

however, vardon is excellent. he is very professional, honest, timely and got the job done quickly. i highly recommend him!"
262,"my ac was making a weird sound and wasn't cooling. i have a warranty for this with another company and the repair tech they sent quoted me $2100 for a bad compressor. so of course i wanted a second opinion and called ahwa. bill came out and found that it's just a dead capacitor; $205 total. the ac is now working and i'm not as grouchy.  i trust ahwa and will always call them for my ac needs. 

fun fact: i understand that their techs don't work for commission and don't ""upsell"" customers; they are paid a fair wage and are not overworked."
263,"my house is 40 years old, with a stucco exterior that showed significant deterioration at points in contact with the ground.  i had a stucco company come and do repairs on the stucco - see the photos.  i then needed to have all the stucco repainted.
i contacted a number of painting companies before settling on crash of rhinos (cofr) in spite of their weird name.  i was greatly impressed with the professionalism of the whole process from initial contact and site visit, to the streamlined quote and agreement procedures.  everything was totally spelled out as to what would be done, and everything i thought should be done and more was part of the package.
the terrain of much of my property is sloped with landscaping and rocks making working conditions very difficult when it came to masking off areas not to receive paint.  yet the cofr did a fantastic job of navigating the terrain and applying primer to new stucco plus drylock to areas in contact with the ground, and then at least two coats of final paint.
the cofr crew was always totally polite and professional, always letting me know what was going to happen and contacting me in advance to ok any special procedures necessitated by unique circumstances.
the bid was a little higher than others, but i felt that their reputation warranted their bid.  the results were fantastic - no photos of the end result are provided because it is all looks perfect and that's all i need to say.
i highly recommend crash of rhinos."
264,"these helped me install my fan today. they were fast very highly professional. i was impressed by their speed, and their charges were also very reasonable. i believe their website is
http://soshandyman.ca/"
265,"loving  it and the renovations are beautiful and fun with a glimpse of the ""then and now"" art.  clean room and fully stocked with everything you could need including a safe and mini fridge.  close to everything (definitely walking distance).  parking is $15.00 for 24 hours (self parking).  not bad.  paradise buffet... omelette bar was my favorite!"
266,"did an amazing job on the exterior of our home. professional, courteous and timely.  repaired the stucco on the fence and repainted it also. looks like a new home. i would highly recommend them!"
267,"new home and had a random list of repairs and upgrades.. no problem for gary.  will be my ""go to"" for all that comes up."
268,"i recently called first thing in the morning after my garage door malfunctioned. they were able to set me up with a same-day appointment. the knowledgeable, polite and respectful  technician was able to quickly diagnose the problem, give me all my options and complete the repairs in under an hour.  he installed a good unit annd a new outdoor keypad.  the opener is much quieter thatn the old one."
269,these guys are amazing. ryan did an excellent job. i know i can depend on this company for future repairs.
270,"we moved from california to arizona. we had just had gas lines ran through the home we had just purchased. we are new to the area (surprise) and saw his sign on his truck. so my husband gave him a call.  the repair work needed consisted of the formal living room, (next to where the gas lines come into the house), kitchen, and laundry room. we asked bill if he would provide us with a estimate in order to have some work done.  bill showed up as scheduled, told us how much, we asked if he could do the work and it was able to complete it the same day. very professional, cleaned up all of the debris. we will use bill in the future and will also refer anyone to bill that needs to have drywall work done. excellent job!! thank you so much."
271,"i'm thrilled with the repair on my mercedes!  
they did a great job. they had to correct repairs that someone really messed up.

272,been to him pete many times save me a lot of money on repairs highly recommend honest  shows exactly what's wrong and the least expensive way to fix it right
273,we just moved into an older home that had some pretty extensive mold damage. we called moldex to come out and remove the mold and repair damage.  they did an amazing job. they were completely professional and their drywall work was perfect. i can't even tell that there was ever a problem. great job!
274,"in the madison market, i can sometimes be selfishly hesitant to give out all my good names for hone experts. we gutted our kitchen and are doing a full remodel with christensen construction. mick is our contractor. it has been the best experience in home repair and.or remodeling we have ever had. that says a lot! we have owned 6 homes and have done significant work in all of them. everyone is helpful, professional, and the work is superb. at the onset of our project, i was given a detailed time-line and it has been impeccable. so, as much as i hate to share, i would highly recommend the team at christensen construction to anyone need work done in madison."
275,merri was unbelievable in our real estate journey. she fought so hard for us and got us the best deal i could even think of. she put offers on all the homes we wanted and wouldn't give up till we got the dream home we wanted. she always kept our interests first no matter what. she was a bulldog when it came to fighting for us. she made sure the seller helped us out with renovations and closing costs. she protected out interests financially and negotiated each and every aspect of the contract for us. she was there till the very end even meeting at our home at 10pm at night the evening before we closed to make sure our walk thru was done because my schedule was so tight. merri and her team and so very professional but i can truly say the only reason we got this home and deal is because of merri being our realtor. she is a 10 star in my book!
276,"my wife and i have been in las vegas for approximately 10 years.  until today our experiences with contractors have not been so good until we met monte of a better plumbing company.

our living room wood floor showed signs of water damage, warping and blackening so we had to tear up the floor and jack hammer the foundation away to expose the pipes underneath the slab.

the company our general contractor hired was going to repair the pipes against code and basically cut the copper pipes and ""sleeve pex tubing"" which i found out to be not the best idea and is not up to code!

another company tried to sell me a $12,000 re-route and re-pipe job.

monte sent our one of his employees charles who gave us direction on how to further excavate the area so they could get access to do the proper brazing of the new copper pipes. charles was extremely professional and courteous and was a pleasure to deal with.

monte showed up on time with his assistant mike and my wife and i cannot be any happier with how they did the job.  they were professional , courteous and clean and monte even replaced an aerator in one of our bathrooms for free,

i give monte and his staff my highest recommendation that i can give for all the reasons that i cited.  you will not find a better plumber in las vegas!

cheers and thank you monte and staff!"
277,"i had some repairs needed, i called bill and asked him about getting a quote. he made it very easy for me and asked me to send him pictures of the damaged walls. he gave me a quote the same day and sent someone the next day. they did a great job! i'm saving his number for future use."

279,"i usually pick contractors with the highest and most reviews but couldn't find anyone that could accept the job that i asked for. i needed a outdoor ceiling fan mounted to our outdoor patio but 3 contractors said they couldn't do it because there wasn't a support beam installed within the patio cover to support the weight of the ceiling fan. 

gadi responded to my request very quickly thru yelp messenger and agreed to take a look at my request.  he evaluated the situation and said it was possible for him to make it work. 2 days later he came on time and was able to install a support beam on top on the patio cover to support the ceiling fan.

it was also a surprise to find out that he lives in the same neighborhood as me.  my search is over to find a handyman that can do it all.  gad is very friendly, trustworthy, and he won't charge you an arm and a leg to complete a job!"

285,"we found out our hot tub wasn't working after closing on our new home. major disappointment.

294,i have been renting a house from this company for four years.  i work with patricia oricht.  i can't say enough good things about her!!  she has been the best person to deal with.  over the years i've had a few issues that needed to be attended to.  she is so prompt.  she immediately gets in touch of repair people to help with the problem.  she asks them to call me as soon as they can so we can schedule the repair. she is always  very courteous and happy to accommodate!  i couldn't be happier!!

302,"tracy is amazing! both tracy and andie make coming here so much fun and stress free. since i have acrylics i primarily see tracy, but both her and andie do flawless work. i definitely recommend this salon to anyone. and as a plus, online scheduling is a breeze! but they are always extremely responsive in text or call if i have questions on what i should be booking or if i need a quick repair."
303,drywall perfection came out the next day to repair bathroom ceiling drywall damaged from an ac leak. they did a very professional job. we will not hesitate to call them again if we need more drywall repairs done.

305,"i put in a special order here, and i received it in a reasonable amount of time.  no complaints on my end.

the gentleman who took my order was friendly, and i was happy that one of his distributors had my difficult to find item.

if they don't have what you are after, just ask - i'm sure they can get it for you!

my only suggestion to them would be to repair or replace their broken street sign!"
306,"i've been having multiple issues with my ac, but after multiple repair attempts danny came out, and resolved the issue. he was polite, professional, and came out right away which means a lot because vegas can get really hot. i will always recommend him to family, and friends, along with you yelp reader to give them a call for your ac/heating issues. i would give more stars but the limit is five!"

309,we had john from tubby's tile repair some spiderweb cracks in our fiberglass shower enclosure.  the job was done way better than i expected.  you can't even tell that it was repaired and they even matched the same texture and faux groutlines.  would definitely use them again!!
310,"what an amazing owner run company.   i had rafael out to clean and seal our granite.  such an honest professional gentleman that rather than doing the job, taking our money and being done, he noticed we are in a new house and a piece of our marble had been repaired in kind of a sneaky way. so he suggested that we contact our builder about our warranty.   
good thing, if we sealed it the warranty would be void.
cost rafael the job, but i am his customer for life and will refer him to anyone.  honesty is a rare commodity and i really appreciate it."
311,i had them repair my remote start and trunk on my 2005 chevrolet malibu. the estimate is pricey but it does go towards the work should you authorize the work to be done. i really have appreciated having the remote start on a few of the cold mornings lately. it is also nice to have my trunk stay open without me trying to keep it open with my head.
312,"cornelio has repaired several pieces of furniture for us, and he has always done a fantastic job!!!
highly recommend him to anyone."
313,"best plumbing company out there! 

we had a large plumbing issue in our condo. the cast iron pipes that drain all our plumbing in our master bathroom were cracked and needed to be repair. damon and his intern nathan came and did an outstanding job! they did everything they could to not destroy our newly remodeled unit to access these pipes. damon is an incredibly skilled plumber and the got the job done in one day (he had to replace three cast iron drain pipes). the best part about working with damon is he will try his absolute hardest to not have to damage your stuff in order to access the pipes. he saved our shower (didn't cut into it as most plumbers would have), our kitchen cabinets (went around even though it made his job harder), and also our vanity (just cut behind it without having to rip it out - most plumbers would have just ripped it out). 10 out of 10 would recommend! and be sure to ask for damon, i promise you will not be disappointed!"
314,"completely impressed!  so many great things to say; prompt, knowledgeable, fair priced, thorough.  on top of this, nick and allen really seem to love what they do and it's a pleasure to be around and do business with them.  nick is noticeably busy as others have obviously figured out his expertise, definitely worth it should you have to wait a couple extra days.  i had repair in two locations, one the drip wouldn't turn off and the other was sprinkler/drip that wouldn't come on (also had some emitter issues)."
315,"these guys have installed one water heater, one new ac system, and repaired another ac unit for me.  they do a great job.  the techs are friendly and professional and do great work.  the prices are competitive.  all three jobs they have done for me went perfect.  i highly recomend and will use them next time i have a need."
316,provided an honest estimate of repairs that were needed.  the prior two estimates i was given from other hvac companies said i had to have a new hvac unit installed.  tin city was the only company to properly diagnose the problem and fix it at a very reasonable cost.
317,he has repaired my favorite leather jacket a couple of times. friendly. on time. does good work
318,"brad was very hepful, ordered the part i needed and handled the repair very efficiently."
319,"this is an awesome vet clinic run by exceptionally sweet ladies. i took our newest member of the family here to get the last of his shots and the staff made him feel so at ease, he didn't even notice or flinch when the needle went in! one of the vets even followed me in to pet planet next door when i forgot something at the front desk, hehe. they're going through a bit of renovations in the front lobby, but aside from that, it's very clean and doesn't have that weird ""we covered up the poo with ammonia"" smell that a lot of vet clinics have."
320,i have now used them for a/c repair as well as last year for plumbing! greg is the best on time and all repairs done. my tenant and i thank you!
321,"jeremy is a man mans! went in for a (quote from another place) ""$300""repair. he diagnosed the real problem and fixed it for nothing! i gave him so many hugs! seriously the friendliest place ever!!!! so honest!!!"
322,jason was prompt with communication and came out to give us quote right away. david did our repair work and was great with working around the pup and kiddos! couldn't ask for a better experience. thanks guys!
323,"alex and his crew are great.

i have used them on several different properties and they expertly do everything from mowing grass to trimming tall palm trees to irrigation repairs.

as an owner-operator, you can see the attention to detail is much greater than most landscapers in las vegas. as an added plus, alex is always quick to respond to scheduling requests and can usually come out to see you in a day or two."
324,my go-to a/c guys were booked and i needed a repair job done quickly. eric came out and did a great job. he's so knowledgeable and explained everything so well. his pricing was by the hour and he was done quickly. i will use him again.
325,"i was selling a house and needed to put in a new ac as part of the binsr.  i called 5 places and had 2 site visits for quotes for a new 4 ton or 5 ton ac unit with some duct repair.  keith's quote was the best, he was easy to deal with, detailed in his explanation of what needed to be done and why, without selling me extra add-ons.  he was just a really honest and trustworthy person... a really, really good guy.  for my next property, i'll just call keith.  no need to call anyone else!"

328,"these guys are great! i had a stackable dryer that decided to stop heating. i called them monday morning when they opened and they had a repair man out there ready to work on it by the early afternoon. my case was one where a part needed to be ordered and they got out there the next day. super affordable, friendly and honest! will definitely  go to them again for further support! highly recommend!"
329,"i'm a local contractor here in town and design district is my go to for all my design needs. they specialize in renovations for investment homes and flips. they keep everything looking great and on budget. they prepare a design packet for each project with all the links to purchase materials needed. every detail listed by area with photos so there's no confusion. it makes it so easy for me and my guys to find, purchase and install everything.
i also use them for staging all my flips since they offer investor pricing for ongoing business. i wouldn't trust anyone else with my investments."

332,"steve and irene are honest, hard working and true hvac pros!  they never suggest replacement of the unit when a simple repair will do.  call them for your heating and a/c needs, you won't be sorry."
333,"nick was friendly, fast, and affordable.  great! he repaired a leak and then checked my whole system for no additional charge."
334,"i have used clear view many times, for plumbing and ac work. they have always been prompt, courteous and provided different options for repairs"
335,"gabe @ one shot was amazing!.  i had a problem with 2 ceiling fans and was looking for someone to install new ones.  upon arriving on site, gabe quickly realized that it would be easier (and cheaper!) to make a couple of minor repairs to both systems and did so.  arrived on time; did professional for; and saved me money in long run :)

i have found my new electrician!   i recommend one shot highly!"
336,"these guys are terrific.  i brought my hover board in for repair and explained the problem as best i could.  they gave me a preliminary diagnosis and an estimated cost.  about an hour later it was fixed.  the issue turned out to be exactly as they had thought.  they also checked out all of the internal parts and let me know that i had purchased a great hover board model.  with all of the stories on the internet about boards catching on fire, this news gave me a lot of peace of mind.  had i known these guys existed before, i definitely would've purchased my original hover board from them.  absolutely great experience!!"
337,"these guys are excellent!  my a/c unit died and these guys were so awesome in not only diagnosing the problem but getting it expedited for repairs as well.  i have to give a huge thank you to all the members that helped me through this crisis at a-1...especially eric and don (donald).  these two guys were ""johnny on the spot"" in not only diagnosing the problem but getting it repaired, expeditiously.  although i had to wait through 5 hot days before my a/c was repaired, it wasn't because of a-1...it was my how.  anyway, this review is not written about my how, but rather to give ""kudos"" to a-1, eric and don...thank you all!"
338,"mcqueen plumbing came out when the said they would and saved me hundreds of dollars.another company (everything plumbing llc) said it would be $400 dollars to do a repair that was not needed.mcqueen plumbing was honest,fair,and did the repair for a very reasonable price.they have my trust and will use them again!"
339,"i had a good experience, but had read some reviews that suggested there could be a not great experience.

but they are in my part of town,m i needed a suitcase repaired, and i have always wanted to come in here. so i dropped off the suitcase and hoped for the best.

which happened. they did have to update their quote - which was reasonable - to replace two of the wheels instead of one (i had been hoping but wasn't totally surprised).

i can not remember if it took 2 or 3 weeks, but it was easier than if i had tried to get the parts and do it myself. i have been very happy with their work."
340,"nick is the best! we have used him several times now and no matter what he always responds quickly and if he can comes the same day if it's an emergency. he is affordable, efficient and good at what he does. i highly recommend him for all your sprinkler repairs. his knowledge is golden!! our plants are thriving thanks to him."

343,"i found dean based on two 5 star reviews on yelp. he came by and assessed the job and i liked his estimate. he started the next morning on time and was finished with the prep work in 30 minutes or so. i added a job for him to remove a decorative wall and again, his estimate was what i would have expected. to simply speed up the job due to a time constraint i had, i removed the wall myself and had him repair where the wall had contacted another wall and the ceiling. i told him to keep his estimate the same; however, he reduced the price by 1/3. he was very courteous, worked quickly and kept the area clean while he worked and when he finished and left.i would definitely hire him again for my drywall needs."
344,"dean is a very professional tradesman. first off, his communication was prompt and thorough. out of five drywall companies i called for quotes, dean was one of two who returned my call (and within a few hours). he bid the job to retexture all ceilings in a 1800sq.ft house, and came in around the mid-range for quotes. 

showed up when he said he would. clean. organized. attention to detail. finished the job on time and even worked with my crazy time-line so i could come in behind him and paint as soon as the texture was dry enough. he took time to explain to me how the process would go and gave me a few pointers for basic drywall repair i could do myself in the future. 

thanks dean! great job."
345,i continually go to wayne's for my bagels.  they are so good and i love all the sesame seeds.  they are piled on.  this is my second review on wayne's.  since i've been going they have cleaned the place up a bit so i have given it an extra star.  they are always friendly.  but this place is in serious need of a renovation.

the 3 installers worked very well and efficiently together and kept working till the job was done. they cleaned up after themselves and made sure we knew how it all worked. 
we had a couple small problems a day or two later and alex and john came out right away to solve the problem and get it repaired.

371,i love yelp because having the comments bellow helped me make my decision easier on which company should get my business. i needed an installation of a new garage door with a new motor because the old one didn't work and i had to pull it down and up by hand. when i called i got a detailed breakdown of the process and the cost including labor. i've had scheduled the technician on tuesday morning and he came on time which was very important for me because i needed to get my girl out of school at 3 pm that day. he installed my garage door and a new motor in no time and was very kind to answer all of my questions and assured me that if anything would go wrong i can just call and get a technician to come check it iut. i would definitely recommend this company to anyone in need of repair or installment. keep up the good work!
372,i had broken a heel on my boot and dropped them off to be repaired.. i expected to pay about $50 since i told them to replace both heels. to my surprise when i picked them up a week later the bill was $13!! for both!! and they looked like new.. so impressed!!
373,adam came out and gave me a reasonable estimate and got to work right away. the repair looks great. very professional and kind. i highly recommend
374,these guys came out last minute on a friday afternoon when the other repair guys i hired blew me off.  they took the time to investigate the month long ac issues i had been having and fixed what two other companies couldn't.
375,i can't believe this place has closed down. this was the spot to get your honda repaired quickly. james and his crew was definitely fast and did the job the proper way. it pains me that this place is no longer open...
376,quality drywall repair at a nice price. lyle did a great job. would use dave's repair again if i need this type of work.
377,"i must say owen is definitely a man of his word , if you have any problems after he will return and fix it or replace it!!!!!. owen came to my house the first time 5/1/14 and replaced my old opener with a new chamberlin opener but over the next three weeks the new opener was not being constant on going all the way down or all the way up. i called 05/27/14 and informed him of the problem and the next day 5/28/14 he brought another brand new chamberlin lw5000 model and installed it for no additional cost. i would highly recommend owen for any garage repairs needs."
378,"i needed a repair on our patio cover.
ken came out and sent his brother ben with two others to fix it.
did the job on the same day and saved me a lot of trouble.
thanks a lot guys.
great job / fast and efficient."
379,"these are truly wonderful people...my fiance's ac went out last summer...i called tiago and he immediately sent over josh who was extremely polite and professional. they had her system up and running in an hour...it was 106 degrees...what a relief...
today, i had to call them for my own house...again, 105 degrees...they responded in a few hours... first eric... then ray stopped by to analyze my problem...after many tests they determined it was only a capacitor and not a major repair. both were  very knowledgable and perfect gentlemen. they saved me money and explained what will probably happen next...honest to a ""t""... there is no reason to call anyone else except the cooling co... thank you, thank you, thank you"
380,"whatever the question, the answer is yes we can. they have parts in stock. they do great work and will repair while you wait. the prices are more than reasonable. and best of all, they are really nice people. enough said!"
381,"thank for sending joseph to do my electrical repairs!  he was efficient , knowledgable  and most all kind & friendly.  with reasonable rate. your a plus in my book."
382,"thank you so much!  was able to work with my hectic schedule to come to the house and replace anti-siphon valve. great communication, affordable quote and excellent repair.  i will be quick to contact them if any future issues arise around the house."
383,"i own a dozen trailers and thus have worked with many trailer repair businesses. although this was the first i used in las vegas, compared similar businesses in la, they were very competent and fair.  i highly recommend them for your trailer needs."
384,"had my dad's cherry 1963 chevy c10 worked on this past week.  we had a 12 bolt gm rear end that was leaking.  i inquired a rebuild thinking the pinion was worn out.  they inspected and informed us the housing was cracked!  they suggested a welding procedure to repair and then reseal it.  came in way less then we had budgeted and seems to be perfect.  

thanks for the honest good work,  
yea its a little hard to park there but hey you cant have everything.  
brian"
385,"all i can say is 10000% happy and satisfied. they turned our water nightmare into a dream ending. and have gone above and beyond to repair our 2nd floor leaking shower, into our kitchen! and all the damage that occompanied that mess. from drywall to paint, and everything in between they were awesome. shout outs to jason, shari, mike and steve. i hope i never have to call you again. and i mean that in best way possible, you guys are awesome....."
386,"chris is so friendly, punctual and clean. chris and rick at the office always answer and do fast scheduling. they were referred by my warranty company and they also completed some repairs that weren't covered. since i'm a realtor, we always need vendors and having an affordable plumber who does good work is hard to find. i would always recommend nationwide for anyone's plumbing needs!"
387,"jason, robert and the rest of the quick response crew are absolutely terrific! the name says it all they made it to my project in less than an hour. they not only repaired the ceiling and floor, it looked better than before! i will continue to recommend them in the future!!!!"
388,"i recently experienced some problems with the honda shadow i was riding whilst visiting friends in az.  after a quick search i found 2 guyes garage who were awesome.  they were honest, upfront and told me what needed to be done and made the repairs in a timely manner and basically saved my trip from becoming very costly.  would def recommend."
389,"visited the terrace with a huge group in town for a wedding. the renovation is almost complete, and uw has done a terrific job with great improvements. i'm excited to see alumni park open in the fall as well. as an alumni who lives on the west coast, i maybe get to madison once per year...the terrace never disappoints....and, they have an unbelievable collection of local beers to boot. well done uw, so great to see wisconsin continuing to invest in this landmark and  absolute gem ...see you in the fall!"
390,"last night was the pinnacle of our experiences with the blumenthal performing arts.  something rotten was simply perfect!  meeting the cast was a historic high for our group, and we couldn't have been treated any kinder by the belk theater staff.  the theater is beautiful, as always.  my only real complaint would be the outdated seats.  they are miserably uncomfortable!  a good show makes you forget the misery, but after the show it is so noticeable!  a renovation may need to be in the works in the future, but other than that, a wonderful night with a wonderful show and wonderful people!"
391,"a leak behind our fridge damaged the drywall, baseboard and the cabinets next to the fridge. after another company cancelled their appointment to do the repair, we were in a real jam. this is a house i don't live in, and had driven from l.a. to handle it. jackie was extremely helpful. her guys showed up when they said they would, and did flawless work, at a totally reasonable price. they could've taken advantage of my situation, but didn't, and instead turned a stressful situation into a major relief. i couldn't be happier with this company. highly recommend."
392,friendly staff that greeted us as soon as we went in. answered every question i had. completed the job (repaired broken ipad glass) in the time frame they said. they also gave a discount when i mentioned i found them on yelp. would break glass and use them again.
393,"i called colby early on the day after a big wind storm had blown down my gate. he came out later on in the day and repaired the gate really fast. he did an incredible job and was very courteous to boot. thanks colby, i will definitely call again."
394,"at 5:30 am in the middle of t3 on the american side, i was able to get my money converted. 
it was quick, easy, efficient and painless, all with keeping the chatting down to an absolute minimum. 
i'm a huge fan of this at any given time of the day, but at 5:30 am even more so. 
this location is in the middle of renovations, so it does look a little bit on the small scale, but for what it was worth, it was a great experience. 
thank you!"
395,"bob is the best! he did 2 inspections for me on 2 different houses (because the 1st house did not work out). anyway, my husband is a handyman and he really liked bob's professionalism and attention to detail. we are glad we used him again and would highly recommend him! we've had our home for 3 years now and couldn't be happier. thanks bob!"
396,"jessica and the team did a great job on my truck!  kept me informed via text messages, called if they had any questions, plus they were friendly and personable.  the repair required them to remove the dash, but after the truck was neat and clean inside.  great job!"
397,i'm happy to leave this review - always refreshing when you find a good repair company.  our technician's name was mike and he kept me in the loop all the way through. they responded quickly and so far the work seems like it's quality.   i would recommend this company.
398,"i contacted tlc about 2 years ago, because the home i purchased had a leak in the roof.  someone came out and gave me an estimate the next day.  repairs were made within a week, and 2 years later i haven't had a single problem.   everyone i spoke to and dealt with were straight shooters, and professional.  i have since recommended them to friends, and all have had the same good experience i did."
399,"thank you thank you thank you lawson family for your quick response to my slab leak! i had an unsatisfactory experience with another company that my home warranty company sent out..and got on yelp to find a new company. i was delighted to hear that my warranty company also worked with the lawson family! they diagnosed my slab leak and had it repaired within 24 hours! that was much appreciated because my house was sitting on a lake of water and in an effort to reduce water flow i had turned off the water into the house for 2 days. the lawson team made me feel like one of the family, handling my problem quickly, professionally and efficiently. i hope i never need them again but if i need any help with plumbing..it will be lawson's!"
400,"i was really happy to see all of these 5 star ratings on their page. i had looked at a few other yelp pages but i thought these guys had some outstanding reviews. i decided to call them up and see if they could help me get my water heater working again. i'm one of the few people who can take a cold shower but obviously it's not ideal. i was just hoping to get the process over and done with as quickly as possible. 

well they said they were completely booked up that day and could make an appointment for me the day after. they also said they would throw me on a cancellation list just in case an appointment fell through.. i thought great and chose to use them. 

well it turns out that no one had ended up canceling but one of their plumbers had finished up his day faster than he thought and offered to make my house his last stop of the day. 

they guys was super friendly and was a hard worker which i can sincerely appreciate. my water heater is repaired and is working great again. i highly recommend these guys!"
401,"i needed an hvac technician to fix my heater. within an hour after i called, a technician was at my house and less than an hour after that, my system was repaired. i consulted another company prior to calling number one plumbing and was told that i had a burned out motor. the actual problem were burned wires - a much cheaper fix.  the technician, ryan, was very professional and personable. next time i have an issue, i will definitely call them again."
402,"scott driscoll of dave's drywall repair was hired to fix a drywall area that was ruined when a leak occurred on the roof of my condo.  after getting the roof fixed, i needed to get this drywall fixed.  the area for repair was about 20 feet up (required scaffolding).  scott was prompt, professional, and competent.  i will definitely recommend him to others as appropriate."
403,"not only are the employees at lesco super friendly and helpful, it was a breeze to get my frames fixed without any appointment. i was in and out in less than five minutes with a free repair, at that. this is my new go to spot without a doubt."
404,"our air went out this morning and because of the other great reviews i called legacy air.  they said they would be here between 5-9, the repair guy got here at 6 and within an hour we had cool air.  the price was exaclty what was quoted, i will surely use them again if needed.  thank you!"
405,"i would definitely use these guys again. we had them replace a 2 ton a/c unit this morning, they were there on time, finished on time, and the most polite gentlemen i've encountered in a long time. they cleaned up their mess, wiped down the doors and floors (what repairman does that?) and left the place spotless. their quote was the most reasonable and they replaced the unit within a week of it going out (most other companies said they'd try to get us on the books in the next few weeks). great experience, highly recommend. and the owner, joe, was the one who came out and did the diagnostic (i didn't even know he was the owner because he didn't mention it). super humble, small, local company. local first arizona!"
406,"fast and efficient repair of a broken slide/liftmaster unit that i could have sworn would need full replacement.  arrived in less than six hours after original contact, assessed the situation, worked for just under thirty minutes and saved about $400 in the process for a fully functional unit that should last ""at least 5 more years"" per the technician."
407,"i had a high end sofa and love that had seen better days. they were still very comfortable, so i thought i'd have them cleaned and conditioned. the company that came over to clean them said they were beyond repair. leather like new was recommended and both pieces now look good as new...i kid you not. it's unbelievable what they did to each piece. thanks guys for an amazing and incredible job."
408,"outstanding experience!  i had another company, sierra air, go to our rental property in las vegas to do an estimate. after paying $69 for the visit and them telling us it was going to cost $1100+ to repair a control board i decided it was time for a second opinion. called legacy air the following monday due to the great reviews on yelp and wasn't disappointed. they came out the same day and diagnosed the problem in no time. turns out it was actually a blower motor that needed to be repaired. as well as fixing the problem they also fixed a bunch of issues that existed on the unit including a miss wired control panel, improperly installed ducting and pipes. it took them 2 days to finish everything, but i know it is now done right. it also only cost $540 for everything!  they are now my go to company for any hvac work in vegas from now on. thanks legacy air!"
409,"our ac stopped working late in the afternoon yesterday. with record high temperatures i feared the worse. not wanting to get charged an emergency call fee i filled out the email form online and waited. i received a call this morning and they said that they would be over within 40 minutes. as promised their van pulled up about 30 minutes later. the repair was completed in a fast, courteous and professional manner. 

we were told that we could have called last night. they are available 24/7. he said it would have been no problem. i felt that he really did mean what he said. we now know for next time. 

thank you to my fellow yelp reviewers. your comments helped me make the decision to contact legacy air."
410,"ed was very knowledgable and he was able to repair my garage door better than it was before it was broken. he had over 30 years of experience and they are able to come out 24 hours a day 7 days a week. thanks ed, and a1!"
411,"while the technician was running late due to another job, he did a great job once he got here.  quick diagnosis and repair of an older ac unit.  they will be our go to for the future."
412,"i've been calling on true view windows for 12+ years for my real estate clients. repairs and replacements are always done right, and always on time!"
413,"outstanding in all aspects. had them replace the gas props on my leer 700 tonneau on my 2012 f150 and repair a small section of seal/gasket. i made a parts deposit, the parts were here in less that a week. made  an appointment this past saturday for 8:00 am, i was done and out the door by 9:30 am.  everyone i dealt with was friendly and professional. i should have brought donuts.  i highly recommend these folks"
414,one of favorite happy hour places in town. if you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. great location and nothing else needs to be said. maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
415,they came out the very next day after giving us a same day estimate and repaired our oversized door for 1/6 the cost that lowe's quoted.  it looks beautiful and rudy was exceptionally polite and friendly.  i would highly recommend this company.
416,"at the end of last summer my a/c units were not performing properly &now with the early arrival of summer...i called
 alaskan quality for an inspection of my units they were flexible with my crazy work schedule and were even 30minutes early for my appointment.   chris & rick were my technicians...these two were awesome! they educated me on the units, had a few minor repairs and they were on their way. i have never had such an excellent experience with their knowledge, professionalism and courtesy!!! i highly recommend alaskan for any a/c & heating inquires!! i am a client for life!!"
417,"rentals america is one of the best places to rent from in the phoenix metropolitan area. the staff are quick to respond and quick to get you into your new home. they rarely bother you, which as a renter is very important. when you need repairs they are done within 24 hours. when you have general inquiries they are returned within 24 hours. a special shout out to dee for being helpful throughout our stay in arizona!"
418,absolutely awesome. they just went through a renovation. completely gutted everything. the check in was effortless. the easiest check in i have ever experienced. the room was gorgeous. brand new everything. granite countertops in the bathroom. the most wonderful bed. i wanted to take it home with me! this is the best motel find we have found to date. you will not be disappointed when you stay here.
419,had my side gates painted and drywall repaired turned out good. i'll definitely use them again for any paint needs.
420,they were very professional. i needed a sliding glass door that was so difficult to open and close repaired. they took the door off and cleaned the rollers and tracts and adjusted. the door now slides open with ease. thank you zeek & zed. job completed in 30 minutes. they brought the right tools and paper towels to clean up! i highly recommend.
421,"super cool company. my mom's garbage disposal needed to be repaired. tinker plumbing wasn't the lowest bid, but they came on time, explained everything clearly, found and fixed the problem, and cleaned up after."
422,"i had stanley steemer repair, clean and seal my grout and it looks fantastic. valentin and his partner were very professional and also did touch ups the next day after grout repairs had settled."
423,"as far as the work he was hired to perform, all is good, however when he was done, there was no clean up. dust and particles from the repair were all over the floor."
424,"wish i could give ten stars!  spoke to sweet lisa to set up an appointment, she assured me that a technition would be out, same day!  andy arrived, very clean polite and professional.  we were getting a second opinion as another company told us that we needed a new unit.  he diagnosed the problem, left to get the part, repaired the unit in less than an hour and a half.  charged me a very reasonable rate. told me my a/c unit looks to be in great shape, no need for a replacement.
thank god for honest, trustworthy businesses like andrews!!!"
425,"we started having a really nasty knocking sound when we turned off the water in the main bathroom. we called las vegas plumbing because they were recommended very highly by one of our friends. steve came out to assess the situation. he let us know that two men would be needed to come out the next day to go into the attic to do the work. sure enough the next day to men came out. they spent about an hour in the attic assessing the situation. they realized that the noise was coming from inside the wall rather than in the attic. they would need to open a large chunk of our wall in order to do the repair. because we are planning to paint in about 6 months we asked if we could put off doing the work for 6 months. no problem they told us. because they didn't do the repair, they did not charge us despite the fact that they were about three man hours of work put in already. they were punctual, honest and a pleasure to deal with. they have a customer for life."
426,"how honest...even though they couldnt repair my sealed trunk they tried their best and did not try to sell me something false.

i really appreciate them"
427,"honest, dependable and reliable is all i have to say about greg and legacy air. if you a/c stops blowing, make the right call to legacy air. he won't charge you for a new unit if all you need is the unit cleaned. but, be patient, this is a busy summer for legacy air. if you need a/c repair, legacy get to you as soon as possible."
428,"great company, honest, and reasonable prices!  i was able to get a same day appointment and the company texted me before the technician arrived.  denis was friendly and courteous.  i totally was expecting a repair that was in the 100's of dollars - since it seems like nobody will even look at a problem without wanting a hundred bucks.  denis found a quick fix and was done in about 30 minutes, and for only $35!  highly recommend!"
429,we came here when it was slow so we didn't have a wait and the waitress was attentive. the booths do need som repair they have tape on them and are peeling up a little.
430,"the most honest ac repair workers we've met! we've had multiple ac repair companies check our ac out and they kept saying that we needed to replace the whole ac unit, costing a minimum of $5,000. but when dean came along, he was able to figure out what the real problem was, and fixed the ac for only $500. we strongly recommend this company!"
431,"absolutely amazing!!  i had a big plumbing job done (full re-route from slab) and the plumbers had to make 20 holes in the drywall (walls and  ceiling) - holes in every shape except rectangular.  mike's team came in and patched every hole and even fixed a couple of stress cracks.  it's impossible to find any trace of the repair work.  also, they did a great job keeping everything neat and clean - and drywall can leave bad mess.  mike's is my new go-to for all drywall work.  great job!!"
432,"i used bridge home inspections when purchasing a home. i know my way around home repairs pretty good but it's always good to have an official inspection. the inspector found some structure issues and advised looking further into them. low and behold the house had been flagged by the accessor for structure problems in 1999 and no record of ever being repaired. dustin literally saved me from making a $415,000 mistake so i will definitely be using them for my next home purchase."
433,"i've used number one plumbing, heating, and air multiple times and have been extremely satisfied with the professionalism and quality of work from their technicians every time.  recently had an issue with a leaky hvac unit and they were able to repair the issue (and even preventative maintenance on the second hvac unit) for less than half of what other companies were quoting.  highly recommend them!"
434,i had my truck repaired here about 2 years ago. i could not tell the difference from mine compared to a new one. they did a great job. so much so that i just brought my suv to them to repair the hail damage we received last week.
435,this is a new favorite for smog and repair. friendly staff and a great price on smog check!! definitely go here guys!! 7.77
436,we've had scott out a couple times and he is great. highly recommend him for small projects and repairs. his prices are reasonable and his quality is top notch.
437,"my friends and i just recently went in to madisons for a friends birthday weekend, and although we didn't eat anything, the waitress we had was just adorable, and the renovations they underwent really spruced the place up to a moxie's level. way to go madisons!"
438,"how honest...even though they couldnt repair my sealed trunk they tried their best and did not try to sell me something false.

i really appreciate the jonesty"
439,"we were told that we had a great deal of water damage from a company that the plumber sent out. not happy with that i wanted a second opinion. devan came out and i am glad he did. his assessment of the damage was far less than the the other company. devan opened up the wall and set a heater to dry it out before any additional damage was done. the wall was repaired the following day. the next time i have any kind of problem with something in the house, the first call i make will be to devan."
440,the expertise and patience exhibited by frank and gary as they replaced a transom window and repaired an abutted window were second to none. they offered thorough explanations throughout the process (estimate to installation) and even cleaned up after completing the job. (september 2016)
441,"i am a long-time happy and satisfied customer.  i called hendel's this morning because my a/c had quit 24 hours earlier.  i called at 8am.  the technician was here at 8:45.  he made the diagnosis and repair and was gone before 9:30.  the cost was very reasonable.  as long as there's a hendel's air conditioning, i'll be a customer."
442,merry poppins repaired our chimney quickly and for considerably less than another quote. it's been one year and the chimney is still in good shape with no problems since.
443,"i met several agents trying to find a place in phoenix. finally when i met heidi littleton, she was able to figure out what i am looking for . when she showed me a property i immediately was able to decide ,do renovations and heidi helped me through the whole process and i was very happy to see everything done well. heidi is knowledgeable and helpful.i highly recommend heidi littleton- the laughton team as your agent.she is not only knowledgeable, she makes every effort to understand your needs and she very prompt in reply and follow through on things needed to be done."
444,"this is a great cleaners, they clean on site and i have never lost anything. they sow and patch, repair clothes. alot of times you can get your clothes the same day."
445,"brad had call from. sunny plummer an we talk for about 40 minutes. anyway to make a long story short. he said he going to send someone out. to replace my pv value. at no cost to me. anyway. chris shows up at my door step an he said to we. i will replace the value. i will have it working properly an give me an hour, plus he gonna close the  water, for that time. chris called me out ealy than an hour. repaired the pv vale, also had informed me that he had replaced the valve an the exciting pipes. he even shouck my hand an said have a great day. thank you brad an also thank you. sunny plummer. if you want a great plummer an a great company, that stand behind there work an there product. call sunny plummer."
446,"great place! recently had our truck repaired there and from the start john was amazing! super friendly, constantly kept us in the loop with what was going on and really worked with us on the prices, since we were paying out of pocket. the truck looks great and we are extremely happy with the results. best part john was able to actually even save us money.  amazing and definitely a spot to use!"
447,"my wife spotted gerald s across the street doing a repair at a neighbor's house.   she asked if he could take a look at a couple of plumbing issues at our house.   he worked to fit us into his busy schedule and resolved the issues.  gerald was helpful, friendly, honest and trust-worthy!   we are happy to have a reliable plumber to call upon again in the future."
448,"very satisfied.  friendly staff, ozzy was very helpful and informative.  

definitely helped us out of a bind.  read all of the good reviews which made my decision in who i would be going with for the repair.  quick response and arrived within the estimated time.  

a+++++"
449,"i would recommend this place. my window had argon in it failed and we were unable to look thru it clearly.
now i have a nice brand new window to look thru.

1.they did a great job in a timely manner 
2. called ahead of time 
3. showed up when promised
4.installer / repair guys were friendly and professional 

5. reasonable prices"
450,"no ihob here! haven't been in since the renovations and place feels a lot more fresh and clean! if you can, get anne as your waitress...she is terrific!"
451,great cafe with best bingsoo in town! awesome place to sit and chat! their place is clean with renovations done a month or two ago. a cafe worth visiting in north york!
452,"great place. we stopped here to see on the possibility of having our rig's dash ac looked at; richard (i presume he is the owner?) was welcoming and reassured us that it would be no problem to have it looked at the next morning (which is when we requested as we were rolling out later that day). richard personally examined our coach's system, let us know the realities of what we were working with, and then was honest in stating that this type of repair wasn't really necessary unless we deemed it so (oh, hey honesty over making $$). he also checked out a few other items for us and imparted little tidbits of knowledge to us (this is our first coach!). anyways, all the guys there were chill but busy (good sign), but took the time out of their tasks and days to help us out. nice moves cassone's! totally recommended."
453,"kerns is a very professional and honest plumbing and gas company. i had them install a water heater and a new shower valve for a reasonable price. the technician was on time, did the repairs in under two hours, and was extremely professional and friendly. i highly suggest if you need any plumbing or gas work done at your home that you contact kerns for a quote. you will not be disappointed!"
454,this place is super busy and the staff is wonderful. love playing a few of the games. one of the games quick drop was not functioning properly. when you push the button it was either dropping to many balls or to few. so on this visit this was frustrating. staff were so busy i could not even find a free  a staff member to inform them. that is why i am leaving  this review in hope someone will read it and repair the game. i love peter piper!!
455,"eric came out on 7/19/20 and after inspection told us that we had three options.  we will be electing to replace the 2003 unit rather than repair.  do not have a date set to replace as of yet, but will add onto this review after the work is done.  eric was professional, explained everything in detail and personable.  very happy with the company so far."
456,"i've stopped by here for retro games many times. good business people, know their stuff. thankfully i have never needed a game system repaired but this would be my first call. highly recommend."
457,"my air conditioning  went out in the hottest  time of the summer.  gilbert with oahu air was there to help. even working with all the red tape of my home warranty,  he was able to get the repairs made. thank you for working with us."
458,"steven did a great job. super fast response time. put in 8 can lights and the kitchen looks 1000% better. i'd recommend him to anyone needing electrical work. just wish i could have used him to do all the other handyman stuff i need done:)

461,"brad is very honest and has great integrity!  we received a quote from him to repair 4 commercial hvac units.  2 of the units were inoperable do to bad disconnect switches.  brad told me that he could not tell what else was wrong until he replaced the switches.  this would have been the perfect opportunity to tell me that i needed to replace additional expensive parts.  as it turned out, there were no additional charges and the bill came in as bid.  thank you brad, i am sure we will be doing more business in the future!"
462,"brad had call from. sunny plummer an we talk for about 40 minutes. anyway to make a long story short. he said he going to send someone out. to replace my pv value. at no cost to me. anyway. chris shows up at my door step an he said to we. i will replace the value. i will have it working properly an give me an hour, plus he gonna close the  water, for that time. chris called me out ealy than an hour. repaired the pv vale, also had informed me that he had replaced the valve an the exciting pipes. he even shouck my hand an said have a great day. thank you brad an also thank you. sunny plummer. if you want a great plummer an a great company, that stand behind there work an there product. call sunny plummer."
463,i am writing this because i feel i need to update on everything. miss communication and a few other issues have been sorted out and the best out come has happened. sadly our slab of concrete was beyond repair and that could not be truly determined until the company came to try to repair it. so i am changing my 1 star to a 4 star and i am thanking them for at least fixing the steps infront of my front door.
464,we were having cold stalling problems with our honda pilot. took it to 2 places nearer to where we live but they couldn't diagnose and repair. only thing left to do was take it to whiteys even though we now live 100 miles away. well worth it. mark diagnosed it and repaired it first try.  others were going to start replacing parts and hope for the best.
465,rich was honest and up-front with our questions and also with our plumbing repair needs. i would definitely recommend. i appreciate that the company is willing to do smaller jobs (refrigerator water valve) and we appreciate rich's expertise and value his opinion. we will definitely call ez flow plumbing again - especially when we need a new water heater! thank you! we also really appreciate ez flow's quick responses to our inquires and their notifications of arrival!
466,"update on the 1963 chevy rear end repair:
still holding up great.  no leaks.
thanks guys,"
467,i've used these guys for years. repairs and maintenance. they are reliable and reasonable. jace specifically is easy to communicate with. he does exactly what he says he will do. that is not easy to find these days.
468,"when i first made contact thru yelp to the the business, 6 mins later the owner responded and said they would call us in the morning to arrange an appointment. they called first thing in the morning and communicated that they would be able to see me that day. today i had seth come to give us a quote on our garage that was broken and a garage opener. my time slot was from 2-4 pm. seth called me 30 mins before 2 to see if i was home, to see if he could come early. who does that? by in all, he did a great job with the repair and install, he was here for 4 hours, and wanted to make sure that before he left, that everything worked and that he repaired any patches that needed to be done. he was up front and courteous and definitely on time. i would recommend this company and i would use them in the future."
469,we had mike and his guys come out and do some drywall repair work and painting after having some plumbing issues. they gave us a fair quote for the work that needed to be done. they performed quality work and it's hard to even tell where the holes in the wall were. i'd definitely recommend them to anyone and i'd hire them again if we ever need any more work like this done in the future.
470,"picked them because of all the great reviews on yelp, and now i see why they got all the five stars.....very honest and professional all the way!!  the bill in the end was exactly what they said it would be.  dealt mainly with brian, and will call him for any repairs we ever need again."
471,"the most nostalgic place on campus! i was apprehensive about the renovation, but they did an amazing job maintaining the old character while improving and updating the facility. i will never forget the day my girlfriend and i bought our around the world tickets at sta travel or having our wedding photos taken in der rathskeller almost a decade later!"
472,"the place has one of the best locations in the suburbs. set right along the river and pittsburgh's largest marina make the summers here great. sure the train tracks are close and the buildings are under renovation, but all in all i thing the staff does a great job keeping the place looking great."
473,just svendsen did an amazing job helping me repair my credit! i truly believe in this program and anyone looking to save lots of money by having better credit should go to go clean credit and ask for justin. this is one of the best decisions i've made.
474,"my plumbing repairs weren't an emergency but they still attended to them with urgency. after checking out the issue, mike presented me with the cost of the repair, with me purchasing the parts or with me purchasing the parts from them. i thought that was nice of them to do rather than insisting (and lying) that they're the only ones with the parts. 

after i approved the work, all repair was done promptly. he also took a few moments to give me some tips on maintaining and prolonging the new parts. again, i feel above and beyond. 

i definitely highly recommend this company to everyone!"

509,"we have had the unfortunate pleasure of working with these folks three times over the past eight months... i say unfortunate only because i would have rather not have had to call for repairs.

all three technicians were incredibly nice and honest. yes, honest. these guys all took their time to show us exactly what was wrong, explained possible reasons why it happened, recommended multiple solutions, and performed the work necessary in a very efficient manner.  one man even suggested ways to prevent the problem from happening again and what we could do on our own to remedy.

two calls were for plumbing, one for ac repair. the ac repair shared some good insight on the type of unit we have and what to do to prepare for the inevitable replacement (far sooner than i had hoped, but we have time to save and prepare for it).

overall, if you have a plumbing or hvac problem, give these folks a call!"

ron was very friendly, efficient, and affordable, he even gave me a few pointers on how to avoid potential future problems.
i've def. found my guy for future home repairs in ron's area of expertise. thanks again ron."
522,"honest, reasonable...i've never felt like i've been preyed upon based upon inexperience, and they always explain what they need to repair and why.  they've done what they can to save me money on repairs and i've never felt like i'd be ripped off at homer's.  total pros--i'd never go anywhere else."
523,"very tasty. the noodles are thick and chewy. one of the top 3 satay that i have tried in toronto vietnamese restaurants. i would recommend this place to everyone. you might think this place needs renovation or you might be concerned like some reviewers about cleanliness, but i think it's not bad at all compared to most of the vietnamese restaurants in toronto. try it out guys."
524,"angela helped us buy our first investment property and she was definitely knowledgeable about what your needs are so we didnt waste time at homes we werent looking for. the time was also difficult since cash buyers were plenty and bidding wars were common so we were outbid on several homes we liked but luckily we found a home my wife and i both loved and angela was able to secure the home for us without getting into a bidding war. she was always prompt in replying, as well as meeting to see the homes, very patient and kept the process as smooth as possible. the home we got was perfect no repairs needed and move in ready, also very happy with the appreciation of it since the location is perfect. would definitely recommend her to anyone looking to buy or sell a home and would use her again in the future."

526,"this rating is long overdue. my husband and i had a fantastic experience with bob corelli at sunset fence. they demo'ed out the common wall 100' chain link fence, trenched, poured a concrete foundation, set rebar and added a 100' long, 6' high block wall (to perfectly match my other block wall). they also repaired deteriorating block at two separate places on my other wall (free of charge). total job was about $3500 and after permits were in place, it took 2 days to complete."
527,"excellent repair job. this guys work out of his house. basically you drop it off, he calls you in a few days to let you know what is wrong. you pick up and pay him, super easy. old school lawnmower repair. i called him about a weed trimmer too, he will not work on the four stroke models because they are too complex. i haven't needed my lawnmower repaired since though."

531,"my husband called a1 this morning at 7:00 am as he agreed to stay home until the repair could be completed.  a1 said matt would be out today between 10-12 i.e. within 3 hours of our call.  my husband was impressed that matt called him before he arrived both to make sure he understood our garage door repair problem and to make sure that he would have the right parts on his truck when he arrived.  matt arrived about 9:50 am i.e. 10 minutes earlier than the projected appointment ""window"".  matt was professional and pleasant.  matt told my husband about our options and did not try to ""up-sell"" us.  the pricing was fair and reasonable.  matt did the work that needed to be done and even did some extra tune-up items.  we are very satisfied with this experience.  we recommend a1 and will use matt and a1 again for future work."
532,"we've had technicians from #1 come out three times, twice for a/c calls and they're always on time and courteous. on the first visit, a year ago, they inspected our a/c units and ensured they were in good working condition (after years of neglect from previous owners) and even gave us some tips on how to take the covers off so we could clean them ourselves and save some money. 

they came out again just as we got an excessive heat warning and we began to hear the fan motor having a hard time starting in the mornings. the tech tested all of the capacitors, which were working fine. and at the mid-day time of day when he arrived it wasn't making the noise, so he gave us the all-good.

less than a week later our fan motor was on it's last leg and we wound up replacing it ourselves, but we appreciate that the tech was able to help us narrow down the actual problem with the unit. 

two more things: these guys are on-time and speedy with their work. they are also fairly priced and won't suggest repairs unless you actually need them and can afford them."
533,"1st time writing a review. ozzie came in here and killed it!!!  the 3 p's: polite, professional, and personable.

536,"had an issue with water overflow when the dish washer drained the water. called on tuesday, they had an opening and they sent roy to fix the problem. very professional, he told me what the problem was before i finished closing the door letting him in. within thirty mins the problem was fixed and we even got a voucher  for $30 for future repairs needed. he even gave me a heads up that we'd need a new garbage disposal soon and gave us rates if we went through them. pleasurable experience. will continue to use for any plumbing needs."

553,"i have counted on robert for almost a decade and he has always delivered. i have given his number to my family members and they all use him and swear by them.  robert has always been good about trying to repair something that has broken rather than looking to replace for the larger payout, which is why i will always continue using these guys."

556,"i wanted to write this review because  cnj really got me out of a bind and saved me money today. 

i had another plumbing company come out to one of my rental property's 5 days ago and they diagnosed a leaky tub faucet. they turned off the water to the house and said they needed to tear out the tile for an extensive repair. my tenants were without water for days and the other plumber didn't answer calls. 

i called cnj today and they went the extra mile to solve my problem. they squeezed me in when nobody else would and were able to complete the repair with no tile removal and in 1 hour. it was clear these guys are honest and the other company was trying to scam me for extra work.

thanks cnj! i will be using you again."
557,"after 4 bids we selected monsoon roofing to repair our roof. we definitely made the right choice. great work, on time, fair price, and very pleasant workers. we are very happy with our results! eric stopped by every day to make sure everything was going well and to keep us posted on their progress. very professional and efficient."
558,my husband usually does all our handyman work but after a simple dishwasher repair turned into nightmare due to very old pipes we decided to call matt mertz plumbing.  they were able to send someone out relatively fast (it wasn't an emergency so it took 2 days). the window they quoted us was between 10 and 2 and i was pleasantly surprised when the plumber arrived at 1030. he was friendly and the work was done pretty quick.  when it was all done it only took about an hour and half and cost half of what i expected.  for future plumbing needs i will definitely use matt mertz.
559,"i needed some repair work done on my hvac unit today and i have dealt with the best technicians from parker & sons!  mike started out with a routine maintenance call, he discovered a problem and had to order a part.  today aaron and elliott came to install the part.  they were fast, efficient and very knowledgeable.  parker & sons should be very proud of these three employees!"
560,"thank the lord!!!  finally a company with good morals, ethics and honesty! hard to believe a company like this exists (in las vegas nonetheless) but it does and for that i am grateful.

i certainly dont mind paying my fair share for repairs, equipment, etc. called a company prior to this, just needed a repair done. yes, i know my unit is very old but i also thought it could be repaired until i could afford to replace it. anywhoo, the prior company tried to sell me a new unit over $12,000 (yikes). you can keep your free flashlight!

legacy tech came in and repaired my issue. he was so honest. he did tell us that it may buy us another six months or a year and that we would have to replace it at that time, but that was okay with us. he did exactly as we had wanted an ac company to do. we certainly appreciated his honesty and the repair pricing was more than fair!  

would highly recommend this ac/heating company and will keep their number handy and i suggest you do the same!"
561,"i have to say, i'm a skeptical guy when it comes to anything home repair... because i always think i'm about to get ripped off.  and when i needed a new garage door with an opener... i figured the flood gates were open when i was inviting contractors out to give me a quote.  i had 4 companies come to my house.  tommy (owner of a1 garage) showed up.  ***on time by the way.  tommy gave me a quote that was way less then the other three guys... and he had no idea what they had quoted me.  i knew right then... that this company was legit.  i will absolutely recommend a1 garage doors to friends/family.  their technician was telling me they do almost 50 garage doors a day.. there's a reason everyone uses them.

and no, i'm not related to tommy or anyone at a1.  but when i get a good deal, i let people know.  use these guys."
562,"the guy that came out was pleasant and knowledgeable, and the prices on their semi annual inspection is reasonable. however they really get you on repairs!! i have 5 units, all are 3 years old. he said 2 of the ""capacitors"" were going bad. the parts were under warranty, even with my 20% off discount, labor was $233.60......it took him 30 minutes at most!!!! that's basically $500 an hour for labor!! cmon, my wife is a double board certified physician and can't charge that. i know they all do it, but that's outlandish."
563,i got my fridge in the garage repaired. happy with the results so far. owner was easy to get a hold of and efficient. we have one more part to repair and that should be done tomorrow. if anything goes array i will update but would definitely use this gentleman again. proud to support veterans.
564,we asked for a quote on yelp and got a response within 30 minutes. he came out to do a repair on a stair the next day and got it done in less than 30 min!!! he was kind and respectful and professional. highly recommended!!!
565,"they resurfaced my balcony, steps and walk-deck in a two-day job. overall the work of repair looks to have been done correctly and looks nice again. however, painting 101 is that they should have known to cover my walls so they would not get paint on them from spraying a lighter color below the edge of the wall. unfortunately, the bottom of my adobe colored wall now has a hazy tan color on it. they also used my hose and sprayer leaving paint all over the last foot of hose and the sprayer itself until i noticed it now a few days later so it's hardened on there."
566,"my friend and i landed about 4:00pm dreaming to get that arepa hot melting butter over the fresh creamy arepa right out of the owen, i entered and it was as i was in a. piece of venezuela land, when i saw my reynaldo pepiada! wenorderen and sat l, the manager was ofcourse the typical venezuelan open and welcoming lady.  she made special provision for us because she was about to close earlier due to some repairs needed in the kitchen, still it was a choice worth waiting cuz she made fresh and delicious arepita that  when  done  i got sliding bite by bite in peace down my throat, my dream was finally a reality! accompanied with a succulent fresh guanabana  juice, the real thing! was heavenly and paradisiac.  i praise god! found arepas on charlotte!  a must for those who want to adventure something new, you won't be disappointed!  the place was humble but clean."
567,"i had a minor driveway repair needed after the plumber cut a 6"" strip to run a new pipe. ken responded quickly to my inquiry for a repair. he was able to give me a quote after i sent him a photo of what needed to be repaired, and he visited the following day to complete the repair. it was a simple request and repair, but ken was responsive and did a good job."
568,"how do i begin to describe how grateful i am that my son chose this company to repair his air conditioner???
1) my son was out of the country and i was handling the repairs with one of his friends.
2) they treated both myself and my son's friend with respect and kindness.
3) they honored a warranty on a prior repair they had performed a few months ago.
4) richard (the most amazing technician ever) made the repairs, quickly, effectively and could not have been more professional!!!
i was loyal to another company before this wonderful experience. now i will definitely use the cooling company and make a special request for richard for my own home!
wonderful company- wonderful technician!!"
569,frontier plumbing showed up very quick to repair a leak i had outside of my house. very friendly and very efficient. i highly recommend them.
570,"we needed some ceiling fans replaced and some faucets changed out. i left daniel a message and he promptly returned my call. he gave me a great quote (hundreds less than my previous one from another handyman) so i scheduled him to come out. he was at our house on time and ready to work. he was fast, efficient, professional, and very friendly. he even gave my husband some tips on how to do a few things to save us some money. the whole process was smooth, and he was great! we have found our handyman for any future needs. thanks daniel!"
571,"i am not very knowledgeable about plumbing topics, but bob took the time to discuss our issues, go over potential solutions, and explain the repairs he completed. additionally, he showed up on time and even helped me out with another issue that we did not previously discuss. i would not hesitate to call bob again with any further needs."
572,daniel is the best!  had curtains and traveling rods installed to perfection.  daniel takes the time to discuss the various options and offers recommendations and then installs exactly the way you've selected.  he's very meticulous and constantly ensures he's doing the install how you want it done.  the best handyman available...no doubt.
573,"believe the reviews. these guys are great. i've been dealing with a few pesky furnace problems and i had three different techs out to diagnose, repair, and follow-up. each one has been incredibly nice and knew what they were doing. they didn't charge me for the follow-ups and the initial rollout switch diagnosis and replacement was extremely reasonable."
574,after getting an estimate for a/c repair at an aaa garage that was extremely high i went to pickart & son for a 2nd opinion and i am so happy to have found them. and they did the job for 1/2 the price ..  i really recommend this place .  they were so kind to deal with and had quick turn around
575,"glennys painting did an excellent job! we have done a lot of renovations and they were up there with the best of them. they were prompt, polite, clean and very quick! they were very easy to communicate with and they did an excellent job. i highly recommend using them, you will not be disappointed!"

580,very impressed!  our ac wasn't working right and in july that is not a good thing.  the home warranty repair company was a week out from being able to come so i called bell.  didn't even look up reviews for them..they were the first that came up in my search. i called at 10am and they were able to come out this afternoon on a holiday! chris was on time and friendly and he was able to get our ac working properly and completed the repair quickly.  we paid for the repair out of pocket and the cost was very reasonable. highly recommend bell air conditioning!!
581,"daniel jacobsen is the best handyman i've ever met. he was on time, did great work, and even charged me less than he had quoted. he cleaned up after himself and asked me multiple times if i was happy with his work. a true professional.  thank again!"
582,"absolutely professional! i highly recommend jared at roof medics for an honest, reliable fair quote and quality repair work. i could not believe the fast response i got!"
583,rafael was great. in and out quickly and very honest. had another company recommend $850 worth of parts that were not needed and rafael fixed and got our system working great without recommending repairs that weren't necessary.
584,"true view has replaced most of the windows in my home.  i first had them replace windows on the north & east sides.  they did such a great job, i later had them replace the west & south side windows as well.  the crew arrived on time, were very professional, completed the jobs and cleaned up after the work had been completed (even picking up small pieces of dried putty that had fallen from the old windows.  some time later, i thought i had an issue with one of the windows.  they sent a gentleman here to check it out.  it wasn't the window, but my lack of knowledge.  the gentleman educated me in a very professional manner.  if i ever have a broken or cracked window, this is the only company i would call.  i would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone that needs window replacement or repair."
585,"i talked to three different employees before and after i dropped off my ps4, each one was extremely friendly and helpful. i couldn't be happier with the repair time either. i waited so long to get my ps4 fixed but i'm 100% satisfied and glad i chose game repair to do it."
586,danny and antonio with desert rose landscape has been our maintenance landscapers for 10 years now! we love that they are a local family and they definitely take pride in their work! they are fair and reasonable with any repairs that may come up and are very prompt in getting things done. the communication is also great which is very refreshing. i would highly recommend desert rose landscaping to anyone needing any kind of landscaping done!
587,"i called manny this morning since my temple broke and i went to a place that wanted to charge me $209 to replace the part. the all frame was $400 so i decided to call manny. manny was able to weld the part and he did charge me only $59.00, he did excellent an job. highly recommend him to any one who needs a repair."
588,nick and his team are the best ac company i have ever worked with.  i called this afternoon because my ac wasn't working.  he sent a crew out the same afternoon.  jessie and his partner were very professional.  their price was very reasonable.  this company will always be my go to for ac repair.  i highly recommend them
589,"thank you fellow yelpers for recommending ron!  we had a leak in the wall somewhere, and were stumped.  we called ron and he came out right away to take a look.  he figured out the problem was in a specific area of the wall, probed it, and tracked down the leak.  his son stephen came out to assist with the job, and they got the leak repaired quickly.

ron was up front about the pricing, and explained how the repair would be done so it won't happen again.  ron took the most straight forward approach to fix the leak, and the least aggravation involved.  i have a simpler repair than what may have been suggested by others and i'm very glad!!

thanks ron, for the rapid response, and finding and fixing the leak the first time!!!  i will refer ron to everyone i know!!!"

595,"i am not at all a handy person and home improvement skills do not come to me naturally. with that, i must say that i've always had a positive experience with the staff at this home depot. somehow they've done a great job of never making me feel like a complete idiot when it comes to home repair. if you live in the city, this is the spot to go."
596,"thanks to our tech, james for the checkup and repair on our heatpump in this sub 40 weather."
597,staff is incredibly helpful and sweet and the studio looks fabulous after renovations!
598,"we had significant wallpaper damage in our home.  my wife and i thought that the wallpaper would have to be replaced.  i contacted jimmy lembcke, with seamingly straight, inc.. mr. lembcke promptly responded and inspected the damaged wallpaper.  he said the wallpaper did not need to be replaced and immediately initiated repairs.  the repairs were quickly completed and reflect his extensive expertise.  the repairs are not visible and the wallpaper looks like the day the wallpaper was hung.

i strongly recommend jimmy lembcke and seamingly straight for all your wallpaper restoration requirements."

605,"it was easy to make an appointment even on a weekend.  

the technicians were so professional and gave me some tips to maintain things and how to save some $$$!  they made the requested repairs in just about an hour.  

then, i received a follow up call a day or two later to make sure everything was fixed to our satisfaction.  

we will give lawson family plumbing our business the next time!"
606,honest place. took my luggage for repair and was informed it would be better to buy a new one for the cost to fix it.
607,we've learned the hard way that you need to have your fire sprinkler system inspected by professionals ... we ignored it and sprung a leak at the pressure gauge. called firehouse and they were able to fit me in the same day! kerry responded and repaired the gauge. very quick and courteous. he showed me how to do 6 month self checks to avoid future issues. highly recommend these guys!
608,"great place!!!  super people!!!  this is a family owned establishment that delivers.  they do lessons for all kinds of instruments and voice, custom work, and in house repairs. they have a really nice inventory of fairly priced instruments and gear.  they do special orders.  they are very knowledgeable and super nice people.  i've been taking guitar lessons for over a year from dave smith (owner) and could not be happier with the choice i made.  give this place a try!!!"
609,i have nothing bad to say about this company.  they arrive to install my new ac and heating unit in my condo on time. i was told that there would be one to two technicians working on the units to be replaced when actually 3 guys showed up and did an excellent job they were fast friendly and very professional and answered all my questions about the installation. a short time later and my request about 3 weeks southwest drywall came at the appointed time and did the repairs on the drywall that needed to be fixed and also around the new power box on the outside of the condo building. i have nothing but again for southwest an alaskan heating and air conditioning. they are the best.
610,i needed a few panes of glass repaired to complete my home sale. rem a d was priced lower than other quotes i received. they had my windows replaced by the next week. both men that came to do the repair were here on time and very professional. i would recommend this company to anyone.
611,"this is a rare find.  honesty and integrity is how they run this business.  very knowledgeable.  they are not salesmen trying to charge you for unnecessary repairs, just trying to do right by their customers.  i love this ""old fashioned"" way of doing business that rarely exists anymore."
612,"we just moved into our home from out of state and used yelp to search out garage door opener repairs.  we selected a1 after reading many reviews on yelp , plus they offered a coupon!  jason was the technician that worked on our opener . jason is a professional . he diagnosed the problem and went right to work. he replaced the opener and completed a tune up and the door opener works better than ever. jason is a very knowledgable and skilled repair specialist and we will use a1 again ."
613,"this guy came came out and fixes my leak right away. 

i was having problems with my current maintenance guy not showing up for not providing how to put work and this gentleman showed up and fix the problem and charged a very reasonable amount to do the work. 

highly recommend this guy! i will definitely use him again for all my future irrigation and landscaping repair needs!"
614,"what can i say?! great company! great tech! jessie came in on time, looked at my sub pump in the basement, turned it off and on, diagnosed the issue and it's working again! didn't charge me at all. i honestly have to tell that i had another company to come out and given me an estimate for $1700 to completely remove my pump and install a new one. i understand that it's an old pump and can give up at any time. but if it's still working i would rather wait until it really stops working to spend that kind of money. its obviously my decision to make and i should be given an opportunity to be educated regarding the issue and not pushed into buying if it's not needed . it's just mind blowing that some companies charge thousands of $$$ for something that doesn't need immediate repairs. when i'll need that installation, i'll be sure to call this company to do that."
615,it is very easy to communicate with ron through yelp messaging. he came to our home to help solve/repair a very slow draining bath tub. cost $59 to fix. he is kind and low-keyed. trustworthy. would use again.
616,"i was selling my condo and needed some painting,drywall repairs and the installation of some plumbing and lighting fixtures. juan and his crew did a great job. there were some issues that were my fault and juan was so patient waiting until i cleared them up. i would and will hire juan again."
617,"david came out to fix our refrigerator and dryer and was great to work with. soon after the original repair another issue came up and he was able to come to our house the next day and quickly fix the new issue. i hope nothing else breaks down soon, but if something does, i know exactly who i'll call. quick, honest, and helpful. two thumbs up!"
618,"was just there a couple of weeks ago and i was disappointed to find the parking garage is closed for renovations so it means the valets are working more than overtime to keep up.  i was told that it would be closed until january 2017.  hopefully before than.  
they were also working on one elevator so it was down to four guest elevators instead of five which can slow you down in the morning, late afternoon and early evening.  
i would still stay there as i have always had a good experience there."
619,"called water works to repair kitchen faucet and install bathroom sink.  michael did the work in a cool, calm and very professional way.  i would highly recommend him and his helpful staff."

621,good theater. haven't had any issues so far. can't wait till the renovations are done. i'm sure it'll look great.
622,"greg has done many home inspections for me over the years. his reports are very detailed. he is always courteous and on time. he never rushes my clients or me through questions. he is willing to walk us through the house and show us what he found. i really appreciate that greg acknowledges he is not a repair person, a contractor, or an expert in making recommendations for repairs. so many people expect a home inspector to tell them how to get something fixed or why something doesn't work. that's not what we hire him to do. we hire him to find things we may overlook.
very professional. i'll always recommend him as great choice!"
623,"on june 10, 2015, i called legacy air because my a/c unit upstairs wasn't working.  despite already having put in a very long, hot and busy day, dave (technician) arrived within an hour of my call (around 7 pm).  dave was very polite, courteous and professional.  within a matter of about 45 minutes, he was able to troubleshoot and resolve the problem and got my ac  up and running again.  when i told dave that my hvac was 19 years old and asked him if he thought that i should consider replacing my units, he told me that he refrains from making replacement recommendations because he/they are capable of fixing any hvac problem.  he emphasized that he did not want his customers to undergo unnecessary and very costly expenses by replacing units when it can be easily repaired at a much lesser cost.  i mean...how honest can someone be?

attention:  to anyone who might be looking for an honest and trustworthy company to fix your hvac problem at a reasonable cost, look no further.  i strongly recommend legacy air.  they honor our military veterans and senior citizens and are true patriots.  i submit this complimentary review on my own free will because i am a very satisfied customer.   thank you, legacy air.  richard melim"
624,"we called for a same day appointment to get an estimate for an a/c repair, from the beginning to end they were amazing!

633,"i have used this firm for years and have always been impressed with their responsiveness and courtesy.  today i had a technician come out for a condensate leak from a ceiling vent.  he went into attic, took photos and patiently explained the problem and several solutions were presented.  i ultimately decided to wait and see if it resolved itself when humidity receded.  he didn't try to sell me on expensive repairs i didn't need, just presented the information i needed to decide for myself.  i trust them to be honest and knowledgeable and unhesitatingly recommend them."

637,"legacy air is a top notch ac company. i have known the owner for over 15 yrs. he has always been a very good hard worker. dave has taken this good hard work ethic into running his own company. 
everyone knows there are many crooked ac companies here in las vegas. legacy air is run and managed by good honest people. their  technicians will perform honest professional troubleshooting to repair any of your cooling or heating needs. i would refer legacy air to anyone."
638,"i just stopped here on a whim for some parts because i was right down the street. i required a repair kit for a sloan urinal flush valve and they had exactly what i needed. it was only about $10 more than what i found online which is completely reasonable! 

now that i can get this project done today and don't have to order anything and wait, i'm very happy. thank you to brett at standard plumbing supply for the help today!"
639,in and out in under 10 minutes with a repaired flat. no appointment necessary. $10. friendly dudes.
640,"have had good experiences with all techs. most recently chris who explained everything he needed to do to get our unit up, and running smoothly. we have used pah for the last several years, and have been here in a timely manner. sometimes you just need to trust the folks that repair, and maintain your ac/h, and we trust them."
641,"my husband and i had dave inspect a few properties for us. we were extremely satisfied with each one. he performs a professional job and takes the time to tell you about each potential problem and explains why. he answers all questions and provides all needed information. dave did the most thorough inspection of any previous home inspector we ever had. after dave's inspection, you have the feeling that you know every detail about your new house. he is extremely reliable and trustworthy. he also performs a follow up inspection of all fixes or repairs of the problems that were noted in his inspection report. his reports are very detailed with a complete list of photos and a detailed description of everything he inspected. we would highly recommend him to anyone who wants a complete and thorough home inspection."
642,"i had the water supply line to the refrigerator fail open, and flooded the kitchen.  i contacted ez flow online on sunday afternoon.  i was more than surprised to receive a response within *minutes* from the office.  we set up an appointment for today, monday, between 8am and 10am.  i got a call that jesse was on the way at 6:50am, and he arrived shortly after 7am.  he assessed the problem, and replaced the supply line valve.  he was quick, efficient and cleaned up after his repair, all within an hour after arriving.  i will undoubtedly use ez flow plumbing for any further plumbing needs.  thank you, jesse!!"
643,called united garage door repair after having another company come out to look at my door.  other company said i need a new door and that a repair would not work.   new door cost would be $1850-2000.   joshua with united came out and said they don't up sell and that of course a repair would work.  i am so glad that i decided to get a second opinion.
644,"these guys are really the very best at stained concrete. i hired them to repair my driveway and they did an outstanding job! they matched the color perfectly which was not an easy task. they are professional and courteous, they were on time and did the work in the time they quoted."
645,we just had our roof repaired by monsoon roofing. they went above and beyond to fix somethings that didn't even have to do with the roof. we will be using them in the future when/if we need additional work on our roof.
646,"i am an out of state home owner and alison sold two of my condos in lv. they needed repairs and alison went beyond call of duty to get them repaired before they were put in the market. she provided me with quotes from a couple of contractors, and after the estimate was approved, she coordinated access to the condos for the repairs and followed up to make sure the work was done professionally. she brought me many offers and was never insistent on which offer to take. she let me make the decision and accepted the choice without any problems. both condos were sold within 3 weeks of listing and i was very satisfied with her work ethics and followup. i would highly recommend alison, especially if you need a realtor who will go beyond the call of duty to sell your property."
647,"we highly, highly recommend kevin!  for quality, responsiveness, and an overall great experience.  we called him friday night, asking him to come over asap to do a long list of jobs on our new home.  he arrived the next day on time and took on every job.  everything was done perfectly and absolutely neatly.  we will always call kevin every time we need a handyman!"
648,i'm extremely impressed with this company! i asked for a quote on a repair and they responded quickly with a very reasonable bid. other companies that responded were asking crazy amounts compared to them. they were at my house at 7am the next day and it was a quick fix. the guy that came was very nice and professional. i will be calling them from here on out for any landscaping needs.
649,they came out and checked the cracks i had in my granite countertop. they were honest and told me it couldn't be repaired and was installed incorrectly which i appreciated. they could of easily charged me and made it look like it was fixed until it broke again a few months down the road. i really appreciated the honesty! would recommend this business to anyone!
650,"tim bohart did a terrific job for us. we had called him a few months ago to repair our garage door and found him to be prompt, efficient and competent.we think we paid a fair price for his work.

recently we had a problem with the garage door opener and contacted him again. he came within one day. we soon learned we needed a new opener. he was open to any level of spending we wanted, simply pointing out the differences between basic and upscale doors. he had all the choices we might make on his truck. once we decided what we wanted, he proceeded to install it. he was finished on about 1 1/2 hours, including cleanup.
we recommend him highly."
651,"our roof leaked. i called confide. confide came over. confide repaired our roof. our roof no longer leaks. -- if your roof leaks. call confide. confide will come over. confide will repair your roof. your roof will no longer leak.  -- if you friends/families roof leaks. tell them to call confide. confide will come over. confide will repair their roof. their roof will no longer leak. -- ok, yelp says my review is long enough now to post."
652,excellent experience with this company. even though the news wasn't what we expected. we were given options and were allowed to choose how we would like to go about the repairs. our issues had been completely misdiagnosed by two other companies in an attempt to elevate the cost of the repair. dans main field guy came out and was able to ease our minds. very professional and knowledgeable and worked totally around our budget. very happy!!!! thanks big guy
653,"i have used suntrek for several years for repairs, winterizing and summer turn on.  very good and efficient!
would highly recommend!"
654,"we contacted this company to get a quote on some needed repairs related to a house inspection for a house sale. joshua arrived and gave a quote in person. we talked over the work that he was going to do and the estimate was reasonable: replace p-trap in one bathroom sink, set and seal both toliets, check faucet for repair, and replace tub valves. joshua worked hard and had to leave for a bit to get a tool. i appreciate that he didn't talk down to me as we talked about the repairs. he worked quickly and efficiently. he discovered an issue and offered a high and a low cost solution. i asked for a middle cost solution and he offered that as well. we went with that since we were selling the house. i didn't ask at the beginning but was relieved to know that the quote included labor. he also didn't mind the dogs that i had in the house and was very friendly with them. i would recommend joshua and ez flow in the future."
655,"4th time here since the renovations and it looks great!

we had a great time, came for my husband's employee appreciation day and it was fun!!!

we had a large group with us and our section was full of just our group, so that was cool!

we had an awesome walking around chase field and checking out the new additions!"
656,"these guys were incredible. after being gouged by another company, i called a1. they showed up within 48 hours (not an emergency). they gave estimates of everything before doing the actual repair, and they explained every part they replaced. i can't imagine ever using another company."
657,"the ac team heating and cooling was extremely pleasant to work with.  they were on time and professional.  the issue was fixed quickly and they informed me about another part that would need to be repaired in the short future, but weren't pushy about it.  i felt this company was fair and will not only use them again but recommend them to my family and friends as well."
658,"we hired kent's company for a bathroom tile, drywall and paint repair after a shower drain problem.  we had signed the contract and paid the down payment prior to reading any reviews.  i approached kent about the reviews and after his explanation and giving his word that he would do a good job and meet our schedule, we hired them.
we were not disappointed as they did a very good job and finished on time.  kent followed up and inspected each day."
659,they did an excellent job with the repairs i needed. i was on a deadline and they were able to come out and work with the time i had. i don't think the wife has even noticed what happened.
660,"project: non-emergent repair external gas line - 5/9/19 - - firm responded immediately to call and able to schedule someone on same day with 2 hour window - not only on time but could track plumber arrival via gps app they provided.

661,"we had an ac unit go out in july.  i noticed it in the morning, called my home warranty company who assigned air pro master to our call.  the technician, rob,  was able to come over that same day, explained what went wrong with our system and actually had the parts needed to get us up and running again. he was extremely knowledgeable about the system and had the repairs finished in less than an hour.  i definitely recommend air pro master."
662,"the expert repair team of d'aundre and cody have arrived to save the day. with summer fast approaching, our garage door opener said its final good-bye. a-1 was quick to schedule the appointment and were well within the timeframe. they were upfront and fair with costs as well as a pleasure to speak with. highly recommend and happy to not have to lift our 8' door by hand anymore."
663,"just an update on daniel and how great a technician he is.

i asked him to help me fix some repairs that i originally tried on my own. of course i should've called him in the first place but that's another story. 

he came by that same night and not only did he correct my mistakes but he did it in record time...of course everything looked perfect once he did the work and the price was more than reasonable.

again, i highly recommend daniel for all of your repair needs."

665,"as a realtor, i work with several inspection companies but i used valley building inspections for my personal home. paul was very thorough and explained all the items in clear and concise terms.  he helped us feel very comfortable with his extensive knowledge.  i also appreciate the way valley building inspections prepares the inspection report.  it is very easy to consolidate for our seller repair request list.  i will continue to refer valley building inspections to my clients and would not hesitate to hire them again for any personal transactions!"

669,"we first used mike for some drywall repair and replacement about 15 years ago and never forgot the quality of his work, so when our house flooded in may, the only person we contacted for the drywall repair was mike. once again the quality of workmanship was professional and the walls turned out beautifully and the texture matches the existing texture flawlessly. you cannot tell any work was ever done. it's that good. in spite of schedule conflicts, other contractors coming and going, and shifting requirements, the work was completed on time and it looks amazing. thanks mike!"
670,"wade  was a great guy who was not only professional, but knew his business. he was quick and courteous and after he pointed out the bad rollers it was easy to see that they needed replacement.  he took the time to explain every step of the repairs and we could not have been happier with the results!"

i looked at a number of property managers before renting out my home and i am so glad that i went with eric and mikhail!"

680,"in june 2018 our church moved into a property in disrepair. there are over 15 ac units on our two buildings. we didn't know the shape any of them were in. it turns out, most were pretty far gone. i called andrews to come assess our units and recommend solutions. most of the units needed some attention, but didn't need to be replaced outright. i really appreciated their honesty in not selling me units we didn't need, yet. 

that's all fine, as long as they can fix the issues and get our buildings cooled and heated correctly. they sure did! they changed all of our filters, did maintenance on over half the units, and helped prolong the life of our aging system. we've even used them for electrical work on our outside security lights. 

i love their work, their desire to help, and i always get a friendly tech to come out. we found our air conditioning, plumbing, and electrical company in andrew's."
681,"if you are a gal who needs advice about a handyman project, this is the place to go.  i had a repair project but didn't know quite how to make it happen - raced in near closing time.  there was no resentment that i was asking for help with only a few minutes left on the clock.  albert (ask for him) took all the frustration out of the project - he found exactly what i needed and i walked out with my problem solved.  and - best part - it didn't cost an arm and a leg.  you get cheerful, knowledgeable, affordable help right away!!  thank you to the team at walt's!!"

684,"our sprinkler system timer quit working. mike responded immediately to the repair request, determined what was needed and replaced the timer. he also found a leak in the drip line and repaired it at the same time.  he was very friendly and helpful with my questions.  i will call mike with any future sprinkler problems i may have and i will recommend him to others."
685,"hayden and dre were an absolute pleasure to work with today. they moved me locally. even though i was their last move of the day, they were efficient, professional, and easy going throughout. they worked well together as a team and remained extremely focused on the getting the work done in as timely a manner as possible. i did have one piece of furniture break, but i know from past experience, the owners send someone out who is skilled at furniture repair and they will stand behind their work (and the coverage). this is my third move with green hornet and as a company i can't recommend them highly enough."
686,"joe and his brother did an excellent job replacing our cracked window! they have competitive pricing, quality work, and are very dependable (unlike many other repair companies i have dealt with). i would highly recommend them!"

693,"very, very  happy with summerlin upholstery works. glen could have told us the repairers could cost more but he suggested by doing it a different way, you get the same results and cost a lot less. he is very  easy to work with and goes out of his was to try  to accommodate you.
his work is excellent and we are very happy."
694,"i have been a customer of a better garage door for many many years. tim has always been very responsive to anything i need. i just had a new garage door installed today. i didn't need one, but i wanted the door to be more of an upgrade then what i had when we moved in. went with the insulated door with frosted glass panels on one side. javier has been with the company for as long as i can remember and once again he did a stellar job! need a door? need a repair? these are your guys (and girls)."
695,"excellent work, professional and fair. totally recommend company for window / glass repair. 
thanks for a great job"
696,"my fiancé and i have been on an ""old school game night"" kick for the past few months, and we have had the opportunity to try several local arcades. my initial impression of games n' at was definitely a good one. the owner, who was working the counter, was so friendly and kind. he made sure we knew the ins-and-outs of the place since it was our first time. 

there were many things i liked about this place. 
1. the variety of vintage games (pinball, air hockey, skee ball, pac-man, and so many more). 
2. the upper level had duckpin bowling- for an additional charge. 
3. it is byob with a $2 charge per wine bottle or six pack. 
4. you pay for time. for example, my fiancé and i paid $10 each to play unlimited games for 2 hours. 

on the other hand, as the night went on my disappointment began to settle in. first of all, there were several games that were broken. i understand that games, especially vintage ones, do break often, but there was no one on the floor to even try to assist in their repair. this was a little disappointing because my fiancé and i couldn't play basketball, skee ball, or donkey kong competitively. in addition, 2 out of the 4 lanes of duckpin bowling were broken and the one we used didn't keep an accurate score. 

although we paid for 2 hours of unlimited play, there were a few games that required tokens because they dispensed tickets. i thought the idea of only have around 4 games that dispense tickets was rather wasteful. 

lastly, around 9:30 the arcade started to become extremely crowded. although games are separately amongst different sections, each section felt crammed and hot. we had to wait in line to play several games as the night went on, which has never really happened to us at an arcade. 

overall, if a few things were spruced up, i could definitely see games n' at as a place my fiancé and i would frequent. i wish i could rate it 3.5 stars!"
697,"steve went above and beyond in helping me to find my perfect home. he has been doing this for many years so he checks many things other real estate agents just coming into the business do not think of. double pane windows, insulation, heating and cooling, leveling of walls, i could go on and on. 

he was patient and was brutally honest which is exactly what you want when looking for an agent. he is not looking to just make another deal and consistently follows up with you to make sure you are happy even after you purchase the home. he even offered to help me fix things and dropped off a repair kit after i moved in. 

i have used steve twice and both times have been very enjoyable. i highly recommend him to anyone looking for an agent!"
698,"i just wanted to thank ben aguilar for doing such a great job at my moms house, we had quite a bit of work that needed to be done and ben was very professional and also friendly, he did great work and i would definitely use ben again for future repairs. thanks again ben!!

i am a big fan and we did not experience any of the issues noted in some reviews here. it was a steelers weekend so we paid around 225 per night for kings we liked

location - 5 min walk to market square, first avenue station, 10-15 minute walk across the bridge to the incline and station square. easy for uber to pick up/drop off
room - we did not think it was new york city small, bed was comfy and shower very hot
front desk friendly and helpful
ac was not loud in our opinion, we had to set it low at 65, but it cooled fine.
renovated historic building, renovation are modern, we liked the vibe.

we will stay here again"

709,"i did quite a lot of research on which paint company i should use to paint a couple of rooms inside my house, and all of the outside, which is a 2 story stucco.
the balcony had some dry rot in one corner and they were able to give me the name of a reliable company,  who was able to quickly make repairs at a reasonable cost.
justin was very knowledgeable and was able to give me options on painting  the outside, based on how long i could expect the paint to last.
my painters were johnny and noe. the ugh were fantastic. they spent a lot of attention to detail,  making sure all the windows we caulked well and any stucco cracks repaied prior to painting. they moved items that needed moved, taped, and covered everything as needed. they kept me informed about what they were doing, and asked questions when necessary. they arrived when they said they would. they worked very efficiently.
they cleaned up after their work.
if you want a professional paint job for your home, these guys were awesome. i definitely reccomend this company for your painting needs."

712,"we loved our experience with ian and his crew! he came right out and gave us an estimate, and the next week his crew was over to paint our house's interior. it took them two days - and that included several repairs to our drywall. our walls look fantastic now, and it's all thanks to these guys!"
713,amazing customer experience. called these guys yesterday and within 30 minutes they were at my house and then within 15 minutes the problem was resolved. freaky fast.. just like jimmy john's :) i highly recommend using these guys for repairs as well as new garage installations! 5  all day!

722,"we had a problem w/ a clogged condensate line.  the repair may (or may not) have led to a cracked drain pan.  there was no way to determine how the crack occurred - it could have been b/c of the tech or happened on its own.  nonetheless, alliance gave us the benefit of the doubt and covered the ~$800 repair.  really appreciated it!"
723,"while there were glitches in beginning the repair work, i have to say that overall the work done by all american was consistently neat, efficient and professional. workers made sure, at the end of each workday, they left the work area as clean and neat as possible. staff were courteous and friendly. they readily answered our questions. we're hoping not to have water damage happen to our home again but we would definitely call all american to work with."
724,awesome job done by scott from ez flow plumbing! i am glad i found him on yelp to get a repair done.  highly recommend!
725,"they were referred to me by my father-in-law. they repaired a leak on his tile roof.  my father-in-law was happy with them. 
rod was on time for his appointment to give me a quote for a leak on my tile roof. my roof is over 20 years old. the underlayment needed replacement. he provided me a quote for the area that needed immediate repair and a quote for the whole roof. 
i had mentioned my concern about rain in the forecast. he brought his crew with him just in case i wanted to hire him on the spot. 
his quote was reasonable. they repaired the area that was leaking and i scheduled another appointment to have them replace the remaining underlayment.

i requested quotes from other roofers. rod seemed the easiest to talk to."
726,"i just bought a house, and the ac and heating units are 15 years old and in bad shape. the sellers gave me the repair money instead of fixing them. i decided to replace them, and i had three quotes for two units of ac's. precision air and heating was most thorough and i was explained on the ac and heating system much better than the other two. after i decided to go with this company, i was scheduled to install the units in 6 days. they finished the job on the same day, including put one more air return at a room. i highly recommend them. thank you, keith, jose, and mike.

soong lee"
727,"this is the cutest spot! tocaya is attached to the fashion square mall, and has the cutest look. i love the ambiance of the restaurant and the location is prime! it's located in a newer portion of the mall, where the renovation has given the area a high end look. i tried the burrito mexicano, and the ingredients tasted quite fresh and had an authentic taste. i would recommend and would definitely return!"
728,"i asked legacy to inspect my duct system for leaks and to discuss a split-system.  they were on time, professional and friendly.  they found some leaking which was fixed promplty and at a very reasonable cost.  no upsells or other ""fake"" issues.  they actually took pictures of the issues and repairs so i was able to review them."

730,"jay was my realtor when i bought my first home. he is excellent. he knows the area well, was always communicative and followed up without prompting. in addition, the network of providers jay recommended (garage repair, painters, handyman for dry walling, roofing, home inspection) did quality work and in the time frame they had committed to. i would recommend jay to anyone looking for a realtor. he will always go to bat for you and is they type of professional who goes beyond your expectations."
731,wynn was diligent in his attempts to repair our range. after 2 failed attempts he researched other ways to make the repairs. when that failed he arranged with american home shield for us to receive a new range. he was very good about keeping us informed along the way.

733,"you can see from the moment you walk in, this is a family owned and why they've been in business for 80 years. the personal attention from one of the owners, jeff, was impeccable. he spent almost 2 hrs with us.  he was able to make suggestions from the broad selection of products within our budget that we didn't think  possible. he thought outside the box and we ended up with a unique project. our renovation went smoother than expected. i would highly recommend them to family and colleagues."
734,"we have currently rented a property through aspire realty group for almost two years.  i have to tell you that i have never been treated with such kindness and professionalism.  if something happens in our rental and i contact aspire, they get right on it for me and fix what ever needs fixing.  i don't have to constantly call and check where the handyman is or if i'm even on the list.  aspire makes their renters a priority and it just makes us feel very valued.  if anyone is looking to rent or buy, i would recommend aspire with 100% confidence."
735,"one word: amazing. more words: flexible, understanding, hard working and they take pride in what they do. will be my go to for any project in the future. from furniture assembly to electrical work, they left my wife and i extremely satisfied. we are already working on rounding up part two of the assignment.

737,"i had an issue with a long standing leak in a bathroom tub faucet, the leak was going through around the seam of the tub so i had thought it was a pipe issue. i had tony from lawson plumbing come out and he was very honest and thorough. it ended up being just the faucet and he was honest and didn't try to make up repairs to just get the job he even walked around the house with me to help me find my water shut off since it wasn't easy for me to find. i will definitely be calling them again for any plumbing issues i have."

740,"i had a clock repaired here, they clock is working great and the price was reasonable. they weren't the friendliest of people, a little socially awkward maybe?? that would be my only critique."
741,"sunburst installed shutters in my home a few years ago. i was 100% satisfied and paid more to have their product. i have three small kids and one of my shutters broke. they came over to assess and it was not covered under warranty but the repair man explained how i could fix it without spending a ton of cash! i was thrilled! im buying a new house now and before i move in, guess who i am going to call?!!! can't wait for my new shutters."
742,"the staff are very friendly! i'm excited for the new renovations. i like to do a lot do heavy weight lifting and can't wait for more squat racks specifically. since this location is pretty busy, they try their best to keep things clean. depending on the time you go can be very crowded (monday- friday 3-8pm is the busiest). thanks lilian for always greeting us with smiles and positive vibes!"

746,"used handyman jason 480-748-6507 who was near by, came right over and not only solved the problem that was causing the major leak but a couple other initial installation issue from last years remodel and corrected those. recommend jason and will use again."
747,"we moved in about two weeks ago on april 1st, 2017 and so far so good.  the sales staff is pleasant and responsive.  the property is very clean and maintained well.  we hear there will be some upgrades so looking forward to that.  the only less than good comment is getting the maintenance department to respond when things are not working as expected.  we had to literally call, send emails and go down in person to get them to come out and begin repairs.  we will see if that improves with new owners."
748,"i used ryan and his team for some interior water damage at my house that was a result of a recent storm we had.  they made the repair process painless, and the trustworthiness of his team allowed me to leave for work and come home to a completed project.  they did the job quickly and accurately and i will definitely be using them again for future projects around the house!"
749,these guys are amazing! very informative and easy to talk to! alexander helped me and they kept my in the loop the whole process of my repair!
750,"we needed a quick repair of some insulation on two sections of our garage door and didn't want to replace the whole panel. i was impressed by their fast response to my message, speed of getting a tech out to give me an estimate and were able to replace 4 bottom insulation sections to make it look uniform. in addition, they were able to do a small, odd job in a short amount of time (less than a week) for a very fair price. plus, they did a quick inspection of everything while they were here. thank you so much for your professionalism and willingness to help us with our situation!  top notch, will definitely contact again!!!"
751,"they were great!  had a simple repair of my left rear light.  worked out a good time to have it fixed.  they took slightly longer than they said they would, but all in all, had a good experience."
752,"we are getting our rental house ready to put on the market, and reached out to nunez painting to repaint our fence and do some drywall repairs on our patio ceiling. they were prompt and courteous, and even finished the work a day earlier than expected. they did an awesome job - i will definitely be calling them for my next paint job!"
753,the company was very professional they called to apologize the repairman was running late. the repairman spoke professionally and explained the issue in a way i could understand. he explained how he could save me money and what was the best option for me in my circumstances. i will definitely use them again.
754,"this poor location has had to deal with me about 6 times since i moved into my condo! they are the best group of guys i have ever dealt with. the owner is so kind and so knowledgeable. he has helped me countless times with odors and stains and drilling holes in walls. his team of very funny, kind associates makes the trip enjoyable. i recommend this location for any of your home repair, decorating needs."
755,"whenever i call them, they show up and have the issue fixed the same day! pricing is comparable to other local plumbers that we've used in our other homes and they have never tried to talk me into unnecessary repairs."
756,"a contractor who does what he says he will do, promptly and with a great attitude. i was having trouble finding someone to check and repair my landscape lighting and i was fortunate enough to find sam on yelp!  he arrived when he said he would, called as he said he would and offered his diagnosis of the problem.  everything was fixed quickly and within estimate.  problem solved!  sam will have a prominent place in my rolodex from now on."
757,"andre is the man.  he has continued to meet my expectations time and again.  from purchase to repairs on separate occasions, he always takes his time to do the job right.  he is willing to go out of his way and find the right product, if by chance its sold out.  thanks andre. i will keep sending them your way."
758,"ok, i must start this review with a question; how the devil did i go this long without reviewing one of the premier joints in las vegas? (all answers are quite welcome). this is one of the swankiest places on the famous las vegas strip. so let me start with this, most places after ten years or without a major renovation look dingy and decrepit. not so with the bellagio, this place always looks tops o the pops. don't be intimidated by they seemingly snobby exterior, come on in and bask in the class act that is the bellagio! live it up, you are in las vegas for cryin' out loud!"
759,we had an issue with our pump. they scheduled repair in less than 24 hours. the technician called in the morning to tell me anticipated arrival time and was on time. very polite and efficient.
760,amazing! the rolls where rally tasty and the steaks where we'll prepaired; 10/10 would love this place!!
761,"excellent experience working with stell roofing. i contacted stell roofing first out of nearly 10 roofing companies to bid out a roofing project. mike was absolutely the most thorough, and courteous one of all. i could have saved a lot of time had i chose them after the first conversation, but did research others. could not be happier that i chose stell roofing. they will have my business for every roofing job i have. i will, and have recommended them to anyone needing new roofing, or repairs. junior, and his crew were very respectful, and the job was done in the time they said it would be. thank you stell roofing family!
m baker"
762,thank you to aaron and his staff. they for sure know what they are doing. always so helpful and patience explaining different options. they do custom as well. i recommend them to anyone for a repair or something new.
763,these guys just came to my house and they went above and beyond my expectations. they showed up on time and started working. they answered all my questions about the work being done and even let me go on the roof and see all the progress they were making. stell took photos of their progress as the day went by and explained the process and why they needed to put new wood on the roof and redo the skylights. the crew was very friendly and clean. they also came in my house periodically to clean any debris from the skylights. stell was very detail oriented and always made sure i was happy and comfortable with the process. they also put a tarp down outside for easy clean up. i would highly recommend this company for any roof repairs or replacement.  stell is very professional and they do very good work.
764,"dutch's is great. hadn't been there before and they were super easy to work with. when i picked up my truck, it ran better than new. nan explained everything they did and the price was more than fair. definitely my go-to place for repairs from now on."
765,"if i lived in vegas i would be here all the time!  so many great pinball and arcade games.  too bad several were turned off, assuming they were in need of repair.  i saw and played many that i had never seen before.  lots of fun and next time i'm in town i'll spend more time here."
766,"as usual the home warranty company sucks.  they continue to send my repair needs to l & s air condition and i have numerous complaints on file concerning that company, and they have been directed to never step foot in my house again because of there incompetence.  
so, i always request the ac guys.  once again, ty was on the job and fixed the problem on one of our older units.  these guys rock and the house is once again cool."
767,i had booked a handyman to put together two pieces of large furniture. i had to book a 2 hour minimum although it only took 45 mins? he was a tad late but no biggie he did a great job & removed the large boxes of trash for me. thanks wayne!
768,"i was assigned to crispy air & heating through my home warranty company.  they weren't able to get to my house same day, however it was a sunday. they scheduled a tech for first thing monday morning. he was on time, professional and completed the relatively simple repair in under an hour."
769,"door king arrived right when they said they would. evaluated all the issues i was having and repaired each problem. they were professional, even making sure the area was vacuumed and clean before they left. i would highly recommend this company. if you want the job done right, call the most qualified and get the job done right the first time."
770,"i'm a repeat customer of freddy's. i needed a couple non-emergency plumbing repairs done so i texted him - he responded in less than a minute saying he'd be over later that day! not only did he show up just like he said he would, he was willing to work late into the evening hours, on a weekend no less, to get the job done right. he's professional, friendly, honest, and his rates are reasonable. definitely recommend him."
771,"i had a large area rug with a stone table on top, virtually impossible to roll up and take in to be repaired. miguel from signature rugs came to my home and repaired to perfect edge, re-binding on site. 

thank you!  i highly recommend this company."

773,"called selberg electric to come out and look into an ongoing issue we had been having with multiple outlets in home. bryan was in the area and able to come out same day. he arrived on time, was courteous, professional and best of all, found the problem and repaired it in short order. the cost for repair was extremely reasonable. i will use selberg again and recommend at any opportunity. well done!!"
774,i have had numerous excellent repair experiences with three volvos.  these guys are honest and economical.  it's always a pleasure. kudos and thanks to ray and his staff.
775,great seats.  great experience. renovation successful. also gave senior discount. affordable.

thanks so much!"
779,"my home warranty company assigned edwin gfeller's to repair the air-conditioning problem with my rental property in mesa. edwin was responsive and kept his promises by returning calls and updating the repair work on time. he reported the problems honestly and got them fixed once he got the parts. he got good communication skills too. he explained the problems to me patiently.
i am really glad to get a reliable air-conditioning technician. per my past experiences, technicians always reported that the repairs were not covered by my home warranty policy and then demanded very high costs to do the repairs for me with the need to pay out of my pocket!"
780,"a pleasant surprise across the street from ikea, one that i'd highly recommend. we bought a beautiful sectional here for cheaper than what it would have been across the street. when one of the legs collapsed a few months after we bought it, furniture row sent a repairman out to fix it for free."
781,"i have taken numerous pieces to michael for repairs. he does take longer than most but he and his wife,tina have never been anything but nice to me. they remember my name when i go in and are very personable. if you need it immediately, they are probably not the place to go but i have never been disappointed with his work and his prices are very reasonable."
782,"i have had them for seven years with no problems. i got quotes from other companies that were double what they charge me.the one time something was broken, they had it repaired. they are bonded, insured and your key is kept in a time locked safe. they clean every two weeks and rotate deep clean one area each time. it saves me a lot extra work."
783,"i noticed the ground at the street by where the water meter was wet and soggy, clearly a water leak.  i let it go for awhile until i got a 250 water bill!  wow!

i called jump 2 it plumbing to take a look at it.  they came out and gave us a price quote to dig it up and repair the leak. i had to get it fixed so they started working on it right away... they showed me the pipe coming off of the main water line was leaking.  they charged me exactly what they said it was going to be.  all around - they did a great job"
784,"they fixed my ugg boots..definitely a great job..also, had repaired a pair of heels that i just love! my boyfriend had his johnston and murphys repaired here as well! highly recommend!"
785,"sean is simply amazing!!  no problem too big no problem too small, sean for sure can fix anything. sean is truly a pleasure to work with. he is very honest, timely, he offers the best competitive rates around town, and overall he's truly a friendly guy. it's very hard to find a great home handyman who is honest and helpful and to his word, but sean is the best.  sean recently came and fix a valve in my bathtub which many other handyman and plumber said was virtually impossible to fix. however, sean proved them absolutely wrong and his work was impressive and he left no messes behind.  he's also very fast.  i  am going to definitely continue to keep sean as my handyman."
786,"robin's plumbing did a great job replacing my water heater, and provided a lot of valuable information in choosing the right model for my home's needs. i also had them repair a bathroom faucet supply line (the original, 18yr old shut-off handle had broken, rending that supply line as 'always on'). 

i've not only recommended them to other family members, but many friends and neighbors as well. when you want a professional plumber that will do quality work, i can't recommend robin's plumbing enough!"
787,"dean and his crew with bcs contracting recently completed a project for us.  they replaced a large beam on our porch and repaired several others.  they also painted trim, replaced rotting boards and painted.  they started and completed the project on schedule.  they were very neat and clean.  no trash left behind.  i highly recommend this company   thank you"
788,hired them through a referral from our realtor. ed was prompt and very thorough. as a buyer he let me know everything that was good with the house as well as those areas that needed more immediate repairs and those that would eventually need to be repaired.  from ed's comprehensive report i was able to work with the seller to make sure that everything important was resolved before closing.  i would recommend clear view wholeheartedly.
789,"don't waste your time calling anyone else!! seriously! i needed some repairs done on my clay tile roof as well as a flat roof so i called the repair guys  because of the outstanding reviews. from the first point of contact, ryan and his team were one of the most professional contractors i've come across in any trade. they came when they said they would, called when they said they would, did exactly what i needed without trying to sell me a new roof, cleaned up everything, and really educated me about my roof and how to manage future repairs. their cost was more than reasonable. seriously.  i will recommend them to anyone, any chance i get.  in an industry filled with sketchy organizations, don't be fooled. this company is the real deal. just call them for yourself and find out. 

thanks ryan and crew!"
790,"i've known ivan for a while and every time i see him with his chihuahuas they look so beautiful. he's told me many times that he could give my miniature australian shepard's a great natural looking cut. since, omd grooming fees are higher than what i was already paying at a groomers that came highly recommended by a friend i hesitated to change.  however, last week i had to have the dogs out of the house due to home repairs and their regular groomer wasn't available so i decide to take them to ivan, at oh my dog. max and lily look phenomenal!!! they have never looked so good and totally worth the little extra money.
i love the experience at oh my dog!   everyone is friendly and helpful.  the homemade dog treats and merchandise are fantastic!"
791,"booking through the internet was very easy.  the technician was prompt and did a great repair.  with all the rocks flying around on the freeway, i will be calling again."

visit for all your harley repair and part needs.."
793,"we worked with ron at victory plumbing to resolve some repairs at our client's recently purchased home. he was quick, responsive and did the job correctly even though it meant he had to return with new parts since the repair turned up new issues one he started working."
794,great place. i'm brand-new to the vapor scene so i stop by to see what it was all about. they helped me with a vapor pen i bought online (unfortunately) they took a look at it and troubleshot the problem so i can get repaired/replaced. it's worth stopping in to see what it's all about if you are unfamiliar.
795,"always there for me, small or large repairs. if there are options they explain them to me and try the less costly first, no gouging. sometimes they have made minor repairs at no charge. for large jobs they make appointment and are there on time. have used them for several years and all work has been as expected. reliable friendly, helpful team."
796,i'm so happy and relieved to have found this place! this has to be the most honest and reasonable place for bmw repair. do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and go here!!
797,"we had a 20 year old kitchen island with sort of gothic looking korbells.  marius removed the korbels, repaired the wood underneath for refinishing, and replaced several of the mounted door panels.   the result is a ""mini remodel"" that, along with new door hardware, makes the kitchen look current in style.  he was prompt and reliable.  i would use him again."
798,"i've used lin-air since we moved to las vegas a few years ago.  they are really great to work with.  totally reliable, knowledgable and true professionals.  they really saved the day when it came to fixing a ventilation problem we were having with our kitchen renovation.  they went above and beyond to make sure i was satisfied with their work and that everything was running properly.  i can't recommend them more highly."
799,i have used this business for all of my home repairs from plumbing to installing expensive lighting and hanging art work etc. the guys are wonderful and are very thoughtful and are very good at their expertise. they also are considerate and work around my long work hours and also communicate when they will be late due to other projects going on. they have all been very professional and are more meticulous than i am and don't finish the work until it is perfect. they charge very reasonable rates and they have been nothing but pleasant and professional. i plan to use enrico and his colleagues for all of my house repair needs! you cannot ask for a better work ethic while getting a smile and good communication!
800,filip did great work on our kitchen repairs .  great guy did great work . would definitely use  them again.
801,"totally a fan of cheesecake factory.
wasn't busy and we got $7 valet anyways.
they validate if you self park.
only downside: my bench seat is in need of repairs"
802,"i can't say enough about ryan, steve and the rest of the crew. it so refreshing to deal with a honest and fair company as these guys. all the repairs were done with expert attention to detail. they even went above and beyond and even fixed a damaged area that was found while re aligning some roof tiles. that is called exceeding the customers expectations!  thank you again ryan. you guys are the best. highly recommend them to anyone needing roof repair. they are the only roofing company i will ever call for repairs and for my annual roof inspection!"

805,"since we're new in the area, we used yelp as a referral to get our bumper repaired. brian at bumper doc was very professional, direct, and the work was done in about 1 day (as promised), and  came out perfect. brian mentioned that his primary guideline in running a successful business is ""integrity"", and he clearly proved it with my transaction."
806,place has everything you need or they can get it.  prices are comparable to the chains but very knowledgable and willing to help.  located in a sort of abandoned strip mall but many commerical outfits use them for parts and supplies as i see them in there a lot.  they are always happy to answer my questions and guide me along when doing my own repairs.  very highly recommended!
807,traveling through az on a cross country road trip and caught a stone in phoenix. arrived at safelite without an appointment and had my chip repaired within 30 minutes.  awesome folks and most accommodating. totally reccomend safelite avondale.
808,"found this company a few tears ago when i was looking to rent a house.the owner an his staff went out of their way to make sure the house i wanted was ready for my move in date.they truly are the best never had any problems when it same to repairs,"

817,i am so impressed with johnny's air conditioning & heating.  while away on business my son called to say the ac broke and it was 120 degrees. i called around to see which ac company would be able to repair my ac the same day.  in the busy az summer season johnny was able to squeeze me in and within an hour from the initial call johnny repaired my ac.  thank you so much johnny for your professionalism and true efficiency!
818,had several companies tell me i needed a new furnace and repairs were just a waste of money. steve was able to come out and fix my furnace for a fraction of what i was told. will definitely be getting a furnace from him when it's time.

822,erik was the best handyman going his plumbing skills are second to none!!!! thanks young man! a quick appointment as well **********
823,"the repair guys did a re-coat on my flat patio roof and justin and steve did a great job.  they used a proprietary coating which is superior and will last longer than the material recommended by several other roofing companies.  both of the guys were very professional, friendly and polite.  they also inspected my tile roof and did several minor repairs.  the re-coating job was done on time and the cost was very competitive.  highly recommended."
824,safelite stayed in constant communication with me from the moment they received my repair ticket. i got an email notification who my technician was and a photo. then i received a call shortly after and he notified me of any delays. he showed up with a smile and thanked me for my business. it's the little things that make all the difference in our busy lives! thanks joseph and safelite!
825,"i've dealt with about 5 ac companies in and around phoenix and croffoot is by far the best, most honest ac company there is. when a different ac company recently told me i was looking at anywhere from $3000 - $5000 for repairs or a new unit because my system was ""so bad"" croffoot troubleshot the problem, told me exactly how the other company had lied to me based on pure physics of how a unit runs and doesn't run, and fixed it for $200. 

their goal is to save existing units the best they can and only resort to a new one when there is truly nothing left they can do. i dare not forget how kind and courteous they are to all of their customers. 

it's no secret - the valley is full of ac companies who overcharge, lie, and cheat you out of your money. this company is one of the few rare, honest, and reliable ones you can count on. i have and will continue to recommend them to every single person i know. honesty and ethics aren't something you can buy. a company either has them or not. this company does. go with this company!!!"
826,"i could've easily been talked into a new vacuum, and told my old one was broken or needed a lot of repair. however, i was simply sold a $5 belt and shown where the vacuum had a couple of major clogs. old fashioned honesty, good nature, and looking out for the interest of a customer who would've willingly and unknowingly spent a lot more money goes a long way in my book. yesterday was my first time to shav tronics, but i will be a customer anytime i need anything vacuum related. you should be too."
827,"i dealt with the repair guys to get an estimate for some repair work around my house. they were quick to respond to my initial call, they showed up on time despite the torrential rain that morning. they were thorough, polite, spoke in terms i could understand, and very friendly to my dogs, and they got the estimate to me in the timeframe they promised. i will definitely call them again!"

829,"definity is a great salon in a convenient location. 

the atmosphere is inviting and brightly lit, thanks to the giant windows facing bloor st. with a view of the rom crystal across the street. renovations in 2015 improved the inside layout.

the staff are friendly, courteous, and effective. 

the online booking system works well. i find it convenient."
830,"i could not have asked for a faster repair call. same day response, new garbage disposal installed in less than 10 minutes."
831,"david geller did an excellent job. he was polite, knoweledgable, made recommendations for repairs that needed to be done immediately. he got the report over to me and my real estate agent very fast. i would recommend him and the company to anyone that needs a home inspection."
832,"red rick painting did a great job painting the exterior of my home. i had stucco done on the block wall, repairs to patio drywall and 2-tone paint for the house body and trim. ralph was very professional and provided a very competitive quote. their cost to stucco and paint my block wall was far cheaper than any other quote. the crew showed up on time and worked quickly. they taped and covered all the areas well and cleaned up everything when they were done. i'm very happy with the finished work and would use them again."
833,"steve richardson is fantastic!  i called him in the evening regarding repair of a rental property alarm system and an appointment was scheduled for the following day.  he called to indicate time of arrival, did indeed arrive on time, and assessed the issues swiftly.  fairly priced, professional, and friendly...what more could i ask of anyone!"
834,steve from sdh did an excellent job.  he was very trustworthy and honest.  he pointed out deficiencies in my current roof and i feel like he didn't try to gouge me on the repairs. he was willing to make several trips to my house to make sure the problem was solved.  i would definitely recommend sdh to anyone who has any roofing or stucco issues.
835,"i only wish i could give these guys 10 stars. they fixed a roof repair on second story of my house. they are courteous, professional, timely, thorough.  don't bother with anyone else. i called another company on yelp that had 5 stars and the guy went up on the roof and then came down and showed me pictures of someone else's roof. wanted to repair 1/3 of the whole roof when i had only a small leak. it was the first quote i got and it just seemed wrong. then the repair guys came out the next day and checked the roof. they said, it's in pretty good condition and needs small repair.  they showed me totally different pictures of what my roof really looked like. unbelievable! than you guys."
836,dan called and came out earlier than his appointment to fix a leak and several minor plumbing repairs. all was fixed in about 30 minutes. he was great and knew exactly what he was doing! i will definitely call moon valley plumbing the next time we need help.

842,"we slightly damaged the lower panel of our garage door and wanted to have the panel repaired or replaced.  we contacted at least 4 other garage door companies and they all said it couldn't be repaired and we needed a whole new garage door. avondale garage doors sent out a technician, gary, who determined all we needed was a new bottom panel (which included the rubber sweep).  it was promptly ordered and then installed in about 25 minutes.  they cut out a piece of the old panel so we could match the paint.  it only took a short time to paint the installed panel and we had a 'good as new' garage door for a very resonable cost!  thank you, avondale garage doors!"
843,"i have been going to bo for years, and he has never lead me astray!  he saved me thousands when my smg light went off. rather than a $3500 repair, he took the time to research the issue.  as it turned out, i just needed the fluid topped off.  he is honest to the core, friendly, and efficient.  i wouldn't go anywhere else!"
844,"mark, our sales rep, came to our house to measure and give us a quote on our new window upgrade. his expertise was apparent with a detailed quote and also excellent recommendations on the various options that would work for each and every window. the time estimate for product/installation was right on target. the installation crew was extremely neat, efficient and left us with no repairs or touch-ups afterward. we could not be more happy and are seriously beyond impressed."
845,i love this place!! i went here to see how much it would be to repair my lens and the worker there told me it would be a better idea to buy a different one. he ask me what kind of picture i was taking and and he told me all the sales that were going on. i was going to buy a 18-50 lens for $200 but he told me there was a lens that was on sale that was a 18-200 but cost around $250
846,"took my samsung tablet in for a repair and talked to brandon. he was very helpful and told me that i could buy a used one for less than the cost of the repair, which is what i've done.  i appreciated the fact that he steered me to a less expensive option."

848,"after the heavy rains, i needed a roofer to patch some leaks.  after a very bad experience with another roofer, i called mike of stull roofing. he told me that i had a serious leak but that it would be easy to fix.  though he was only here to give me an estimate and schedule the repairs for a later date, he did the repair work right then. and then, he wouldn't charge me saying that it was quick and relatively easy.  in all, he was here about forty five minutes and advised me that i might need repairs in the future but that nothing was needed now.  absolutely, when i next need a roofer, mike of stull roofing will be the only one i call."
849,"we had a cuckoo clock that needed repair. one of the chains had come off it's wheel. i took it to this place expecting to have to leave it for a day or two. i was very impressed with the employee i encountered here. he not only fixed the problem is a couple of seconds, but he showed me how to fix it if that ever happens again, showed me how to hopefully prevent that from happening again, and charged me nothing. he also was very interesting to talk to. the way things are today, this all amazed me. we will definitely return here for any future needed repairs and recommend this place to friends."
850,"our roof needed a little work. one other company came out to look at it. between being a small job and not really wanting to work on a tile roof, we got the distinct feeling that the other company didn't want the job. when we called the repair guys, they were most responsive, had a guy out to estimate it the next day and we were on the schedule. the work was done on time, quickly and our roof looks great. they earned a five star rating from us."
851,"this company was referred to me by a coworker. travis was more than happy to provide me with his certificate of liability, as well as three references. we had him install three doors and do a few drywall repairs. the drywall repairs matched perfect and after paint, you could not tell anything happened. i was amazed with the lack of dust or mess left behind. on his second trip, he was 15 minutes late. however, no one is perfect! i would be more than happy to use travis again!"
852,"this place is just plain fun. pinball games from all eras plus some other non-pinball gems!  be sure to try the thing by the restroom that vibrates your feet and invigorates the body!  hahahaha. it's awesome.

857,"steve and calia and the staff are excellent!  we've used them for our seaforth street house for about 13 or 14 years now and have been very happy.  they do regular property inspections to make sure the home is well maintained.  when something does need repaired, they have connections with many contractors to make sure the work is does right and at a very reasonable cost.  i highly recommend them!"
858,"after living in a humid environment for years, my canon telephoto lens began growing mildew on an interior lens glass, etching it.  i took it to cris and got a fair estimate quickly.  the lens was repaired in a timely fashion and i was kept up-to-date on the progress.  i found these people to be professional and capable.  i would use cris again."

862,i work at the ronald mcdonald house in phoenix and ati donated their expertise and manpower recently to renovate and rehab a room.  they went above and beyond the call of duty and the renovation was done quickly and professionally.  their crew even removed and disposed of a non-operational solar hot water panel that was just an eye-sore.  ati is number one in my book!!
863,"two words. top notch. this is how i would describe my experience with stell roofing. mike is straight forward and fair. his roofing crew did an excellent job on a storm repair.  they did an awesome job matching up everything. it is like nothing had ever happened. if you want straight forward quotes and excellent work done for you, then i highly suggest using stell roofing!!"

866,"our experience with stell roofing was outstanding.  mike came to the house, inspected the roof, explained the problem, and provided us with a reasonable quote for the repair.  his team arrived on time, quickly uncovered the area of the leak and sent me pictures.  they were quite friendly, and i have to say my lot was cleaner after they left than before they arrived.  since the roof is more than 20 years old, the time will come when it needs a full replacement.  we will hire the stell team again."
867,"these guys were 5 star all the way on my roof repairs. from a detailed, thorough explanation of the quote, to quick communication, prompt scheduling and completion of the work. professional, clean and fair. what more could you ask for?"

871,"after writing a fairly scathing review of this business because they charged me $100 for a house call even when they could not repair the clock without an extra $800.charge, i got a call from the repairman who talked to the owner after leaving my house. the owner decided to wave the $100 house call so they have redeemed themselves in my eyes. anyone who read the original review can disregard it.


."
872,"fast, friendly, and informative. won't go anywhere else. the repair wad done dame day and did any amazing job of explaining the process."
873,"got burglarized and thieves broke my glass inset door. wayne came out, did a quick estimate and was able to fit me in for a repair same day. installers were awesome! they cleaned up all the glass from the floor and outside the door. they even fixed the alignment of my lock with the door jam to make sure everything was working perfect with my door. i highly recommend them and would use them in the future."
874,these guys are great. they have done all my repairs the last 10 years for my whole family. i wouldn't go any where else.
875,"the reputation and integrity of the company is a reflection of the people who own, operate, and work for that company. my wife and i just had our roof replaced by legacy roofing. these folks are amazing. on august 5th we called legacy for an estimate on a leak repair and possible roof replacement. toby, the owner met with us the very same day. he offered us a choice between the two. our roof was 25 years old so we decided to replace it. that evening nancy sent our quote via email, and the following day toby's brother mike brought us some samples to look at. by weeks end we had our order in for our new roof. tear off on the old roof was completed on monday august 10th and our new roof was completed on tuesday august 11th, a day earlier than anticipated. the tear-off crew was courteous, professional, and thorough. roof was dried in, stocked with material, and cleaned up in the same afternoon. dan and his crew arrived the next morning for shingles. despite the monsoon rain off and on all day they finished that afternoon. the folks at legacy said what they were going to do, and delivered with flying colors. i would recommend legacy to anyone looking for an honest roofing company for any roofing needs. thank you so much for a job well done. we love our new roof!!
sincerely,
nick m."

877,i would give higher than 5 stars!  tom baker came to the house for the estimate.  his crew did amazing work.  the floors were trashed from some renovation work we had done and we feared they were ruined.  they squeezed us in the schedule promptly and the guys stayed late to get the job done with high quality.  we are impressed with the level of meticulous attention to detail.  we are very happy and won't use anyone other than baker in the future.
878,"we also have an old house and needed galvanized fixtures and piping replaced going into and out of our hot water heater and into the wall.  freddy thoroughly inspected the situation and provided us with multiple possible options.  the other plumber we called gave us only one option and his estimate was significantly higher than freddy's!  freddy quickly completed the job, even though he did end up needing to go into the wall.  he not only replaced all the pipes with high-quality materials (stainless steel and brass) but he also repaired the dry wall that the former owners did not correctly install.  we will definitely use him again when we need a plumber!"
879,i had an energy audit done on my home. i'm sorry to say it wasn't done by ideal.  i did call them to give me an estimate on the repairs that were needed. alex came to my home and was very professional and informative about what should be done and why.  his estimate was very reasonable and contained far more information than the original company i had called. i had a new ac unit installed and blown in insulation in the attic. chris and his crew were on time and did a great job on the install and clean up. ideal is a company you can trust. i highly recommend them.
880,"highly recommend to my clients and friends.  next day appointment to repair a gfi short in my residence.  melissa set appointment, gave me a 100% accurate quote, and provided the name of the technician.  the tech showed on time and was quick to fix.  he was also professionally  pleasant. what else could one ask for..."
881,"if you are looking for an honest ac/heating company these are your guys, they helped us with a couple repairs on our old system over the last few years and just put in a whole new system for us. they explain everything and give you options. they are prompt and hard working with fair prices. they even cleaned up after themselves, leaving the place better than when they started. good honest folks with fair prices and quality work, you can't ask for more."
882,"i used k2 to repair my hot tub motor. katt was timely, courteous and cheaper than other places i called. i would definitely recommend him to anyone for repairs."
883,"had to call them to repair work done and not completed by another roofing company. 
they showed up on time for estimate and to perform job. worked hard and even repaired some areas on outdoor kitchen, which wasn't included in estimate. they cleaned up after themselves, including blowing small pieces and picking it up. the final bill was exactly what was estimated. 
very thorough, professional and a pleasure to work with them. now using them for maintenance on a rental property."
884,"good shisha, friendly waiters but a bit expensive .
i believe it needs renovations as the couches were a bit old. 
other than that i would say good. thats why im giving 4 stars.

885,"the worst thing that can happen to a homeowner, is to have the power go out at 9 pm on a sunday night (june 3, 2012) and discover that the circuit breaker (40+ years old!) is damaged and must be replaced.  but who is gonna come out to your house at that hour on a sunday night?  one hour electric can!

i called the number and spoke to jeff, who got to my place in less than an hour, and in less than half an hour later, my lights and a/c were ""up & running"" again.

they guarantee their work ""100%,"" and promise to get to your business or residence in 60 minutes or less.  what more do you need?

they have a terrific business, and more importantly, they have a terrific attitude about their customers and in getting referrals as well as repeat business.

but, let's be totally honest, ok?  this is the kind of business that you hope you never need.  but if you need emergency electrical repairs or just ""regular"" electrical work done, then one hour electric has the folks and the professionalism that you want and need.  

if you contact them for any of your electrical needs, i can tell you that you will be very glad you did.  i sure was!"
886,i had them do repairs at my home and business. timely. fair pricing. very happy with quality of their work.
887,a leak in the water line in the water meter box was more difficult to repair than expected.  a plus plumber arrived after 6 in the evening and worked  passed 11pm  to get the job done.  not an easy job - thank you for working long hours to get this fixed !!
888,"a very unique start up. i like their balls (protein balls), 3 for $2.50. i frequently stop by for their balls when i am between clients and need something to hold me over to the next meal. the village has had a few start ups that went on to do very well, and i think this may be another winner.  unfortunately our current city counselor does little to support the business in the area. church street is very rough and full of sink holes. it was closed down for most of 2014. if that didn't kill off your business i'm sure she got more in mind for us this year. maybe more graffiti style art or another summer closure of church street for repairs. like most business can handle two summers of massive construction.

one good thing about her poor planning, lots of business rental opportunities on church street."
889,"when a repair place actively promotes the cheapest solution instead of defaulting to the most expensive one, then you have found a winner and this place is a winner. instead of a $500+ repair, a simple $80 fix we recommended and actually works.

awesome place is awesome!"
890,i needed a plumber to repair a damaged pipe stat! i called and he was able to get out within about an hour or so which was amazing! his repair was done efficiently and at a very reasonable cost. i will definitely be calling this company again in the future for all my plumbing needs!

892,"had a good experience.
door was stuck and tried the usual methods of self repair......fail.
was very surprised that the tech not only had a quick resolution but found me a  web coupon......score !"
893,"handy dan showed up on time, was very knowledgable and courteous.  upon looking at the three plumbing issues at hand, he recommended measures that i take in order to get the items repaired.  now, i am not an expert by any means on home repairs, so he took the time to explain everything to me, which was enlightening and refreshing.  a true pleasure to work with, i would recommend this place of business to anyone with home repair issues or anything of the sort... they do anything from painting and electrical to audio visual!  go handy dan!"
894,"tactical restoration recently completed a repair to our ceiling. they did an amazing job. alex who did the estimate and scheduling of repairs was great to work with. they had to come in an fix/complete a job which another restoration company screwed up. crew that worked on our job were very professional, competent and a pleasure to work with. i highly recommend tactical restoration for your repair needs!"
895,"he is my hero! able to finally remove this diy bunk bed that has been glued and screwed to the wall by our house' previous owner. it was a challenge for him but did a great job. he tried his best not to damage the wall a lot for easier repairs. thanks again jason!

897,"i had my f150 dipped, light bars installed and hid's done by fineline customworks and it all turned out as good as could be expected. 

after that experience i did my lifted excursion and it turned out just as good. we had to do some rust repair and priming before so it was a lot of work."
898,"jay has done a great job for me on many occasions.  i've had him do inspections on many possible investment purchases.  his info has aided greatly in making the best return on our dollars and saved me about $15,000 in a six month period of time!

these guys have done simple repairs for me on three different properties and have secured themselves a place to do work on my own home.   i highly recommend. 

currently working on a repair which will include a drywall ceiling interior patch job.  i'm excited to get this done before christmas! 

good job guys!"
899,sean did an outstanding job he is now my ho to guy for all installation's and repairs around my house. quality work and super personable. look no further
900,"after weeks of research and quotes for replacing my roof, one company stood out for integrity, reputation, quality and fair pricing. stell roofing.

the owner, mike and his crew have exceeded my expectations - special thanks to crew-lead, junior. not only does the roof look fantastic, junior and his crew took the initiative to ensure gutters were cleaned (not part of the job) and meticulously lining the shingles to flow evenly in line with two different high points of the roof - it's hard to explain but it looks amazing.

in two days, the roof was complete. not a trace was left behind to show they were there. in fact, my yard was actually a little cleaner, so thanks guys.

mike and the team brought me up on the roof for the final inspection and showed me the quality work. i see now why these guys are a consistently 5-star rated company - quality work at a competitive price. coupled with a respectful and thoughtful crew, i would recommend them to anyone looking for roof replacement or repair. 5-star experience!"
901,"we moved into our house this fall and knew we needed a repair guy to check out the roof since the previous owners did not maintain the property as needed.  found the repair guys on yelp but also by recommendation.  scheduled an appointment on a tuesday afternoon and the repair guys came out the following morning.
steve and his assistant were extremely professional and pleasant explaining the roof details and what needed to be done. coming from the north east where roofs are very different, his explanations and pictures were very helpful to us.
he even told us the repairs will outlast the remaining life of the roof... good news for us!  we were happy to get an honest roofer and not a typical salesman trying to sell us on needing a new roof!  will definitely recommend to others!"
902,"jarrod and his crew did a great job on the installation of our gutters. they were recommended by a roofer that had done some recent repairs and they did not disappoint. the installation was very done very quickly despite having to climb a high roof line in high june heat! 
the cost was very reasonable and the finished product blends in very well with the existing roof. 

can't recommend them enoughq"
903,"this company is great! they were able to come out for a quote the day i called them and were very professional (measured and everything right then). somehow, magically, they were able to fit our fairly large painting (with some excellent drywall repair) project in at the last minute to help us get our house on the market. i'm extremely happy with the quality of the work and i am never painting another room myself again. they are number one on my list to paint my new house!"
904,"the crew at dignity pluming is great! we had a hot water leak in our slab. they were quick to send someone out, to diagnose the problem and got us scheduled for the repair asap! scott and his crew were courteous and quick. from start to finish, they were thorough and efficient. we are extremely satisfied with the work done by dignity plumbing!"
905,"cannot thank danny enough. this company works with sears and they are very professional. from the lady that booked my appointment to danny the repairman. they were courteous and answered all of my questions, and here's the best part... he fixed my door for free, advised and educated me. the competitor wanted to charge me $600 ish. absolutly would recommend this company to my grandmother! great job!!! you have a customer for life. thank you for being honest."
906,"i went there for some rust repairs. their estimate was very reasonable and consistent with two other estimates that i had already. the difference with lvcc was great customer relations.  patrick was easy going to talk to, very helpful and made good suggestions. no hard sell. 
and they delivered...the repair work was well done, met the estimated cost and was finished on time."
907,"johnny and his partner, also johnny repaired my a/c yesterday. using ""old school old fashioned "" knowledge and expertise, they figured out the problem with systematic logic. they replaced the broken worn out contact device, checked my unit for any leaking of freon and generally made sure everything was alright. best part of all, the bill was very fair and reasonable. these guys are good! 5stars."
908,"the free inspection by nicholas was appreciated. he gave me good news after the storm. my roof didn't need repaired.  

he also repaired my friends roof in gilbert  previously and did an excellent job. there were no leaks after the rain yesterday.

i have ideas on making future updates and you can be sure i will only use jnk landscaping. you should too!"
911,"fantastic work!  movers had really banged up some of my favorite furniture, and after being depressed for a couple of weeks, i found nathan and gave him a call based on the great reviews i read online.  i couldn't be happier with the results.  nathan even reduced the quote when he saw that the work would not be as extensive as he thought based on pictures i sent.  very honest guy and does great work.  if you need any type of wood repair, call nathan he is great."

915,"last night in the storm some of our ridge shingles were blown off.  had no idea who to call and it just so happens my neighbors were having a roof replaced on their duplex. i walked over and talked to ""sergio"" and he said he would call his boss ""mike"" and they repaired my 3 shingles at no charge.  can you believe it?????  i called ""mike"" to thank him and what a gentleman. i could tell how he really appreciates his customers.  his crew was probably the most efficient and professional i have seen in a long time. they had the roof completely done in 2 days.  their clean up was amazing. never knew they had been there. living in sun city we run across a lot of people trying to take advantage of us, but not this one.  i would definitely recommend this roofing company."
916,"sol barreto was wonderful working with us on our issues! he explained everything thoroughly and repaired what we needed to repair. he was honest and up front on pricing as well.

917,"new west managed my property over the last 9 years. they have been the utmost professionals. they have done an outstanding job vetting new tenants, providing multiple quotes for repairs, and are always available if questions arise. 

i recently sold my property, through new west and it was an excellent experience. my broker, stephen, was prompt, thorough and extremely reliable through the whole process. as i live out of state, this can be a stressful process. 

whether as property managers or realtors, i would highly recommend new west. i had a wonderful experience."
918,"oron and his crew completed a window replacement/stucco repair project on my home. they were subbed by andersen. it took a few days because of the large amount of work that had to be done, and it came out great. oron was attentive throughout the project to ensure my satisfaction, held to his schedule, and made sure it was done to his requirements."
919,"calling ideal energy and getting a home-energy audit was one of the best decisions i've ever made! i was intimidated by the process and assumed it would be complicated and confusing but the people here made it very easy to understand and gave us many options. our home was leaking so much energy!
the guys that did the repairs were very polite and impressive, they were in our home nearly all day in and out of the attic and in our vent and there wasn't a speck of dust or fingerprint left by them! 

will be working with them in the future for more energy efficiency improvements!"
920,"jason and his assistant provided a free 2nd opinion after #1 plumbing heating and ac tried to charge me as much as $1,400 for an ac repair, they said everything was perfect and the part that the other company said needed replacing was perfect!  finally a honest ac repair and maint company.  they also install new units.  very progressional and sharp team that are clearly honest!  before you allow another ac repair place rip you off for hundreds to thousands give them a chance!"
921,"a pittsburgh landmark and something to be proud of. recently reopened after 4 years of renovation, it's a great spot for a walk, casual date, whatever. i'm sure a picnic on the ledge of the fountain with feet dipped in the cool refreshing water would make a great day out in the city. many visits to come!"
922,"you don't need to look any further -- you found the perfect guy for the job. andrew is delightful, professional, and totally reasonable from a price perspective (a rare quality in scottsdale). i called andrew on account of a shower fixture issue -- he was kind enough to re-arrange his schedule so he could pop by the place within a few hours. he diagnosed the problem very quickly and gave me two options: 1) he could describe for me how to fix the problem myself and therefore save money, or 2) he could do the repair himself right there. i voted for option #2 -- i was just glad to get the issue fixed right away. andrew is 100% up front, he is extremely knowledgeable about his field, and yes you bet i will be calling him for future future plumbing issues in the future. he's the real deal."
923,auston was great. fixed my ipad lickety split! fast repair and updates. convenient location and everyone who works there was very helpful also.

928,"what a guy!! within hours of contacting him, jimmy came out, inspected my roof and gave me a full rundown of what needed to be done - nothing. 

yes, he told me there was nothing urgent to be done. the one repair that triggered the call could easily be fixed by myself and he even explained to me how.
i quote: you have a great looking roof, that is in great condition, you don't need to worry about a thing at this moment.

best of all, he was so honest about it. hence he is now on the very top of my roofing needs list."

934,"newly renovated theaters with leather recliners and meals/kitchen coming. been going here for about 2 years and have seen the transformation. we have gone because the prices are comparable, not very crowded and digital projection, and not far from the house. now that the renovations are rolling i'm excited to see if when it's finished."
935,"the beginning part of our move was a little rough. one of the movers was apologetic and respectful. our furniture did sustain some damage. the company sent out a repair man who was accompanied by brian who works for the company. brian totally saved our experience! awesome, respectful and treated our bedroom set as if it was his own. big kudos and thanks to him! one amazing man."
936,"i recently worked with the repair guys. after speaking with ryan, he agreed to have his team look at our roofing issue. he said his team would fit us into their very busy schedule. we were out of town. they agreed to work on our roof without us being there. they talked with us along their process & sent us before/after pictures. they were very polite on each call with explicit instructions on their progress. we came home & found our property exactly as we left it. we found a hand written ""thank you"" note in our mailbox. they cleaned up after themselves. we would highly recommend them to anyone having roofing issues."
937,"home pride inspections was on time, professional, through and pleasant.  ryan didn't miss a thing - he was in the garage, on the roof, outside the house and inside the house.  he checked all the plumbing fixtures, checked the hvac equipment, checked the electrical panel and receptacles.  took photos and video of every possible thing.  very impressed with the photos of the roof tiles that needed repair.  it was well over 100 degrees and he just proceeded as if it was cool and pleasant in the hot sun.  gave us a complete verbal report when he was finished along with the written report (with pictures and video) e-mailed that afternoon.  ryan was very competent and it is very comforting to the condition of the home we are buying.  highly recommend this business!"

939,"i got my nikon d3100 repaired here 2 weeks ago.  it took weeks for them to fix a shutter malfunction.  yes it was a long time.  it works perfectly now.

what an experenced photographer knows is that when a camera repair needs a part, the repair company is at the mercy of the manufacturer, unless they use cheap chinese parts.  and manufacturers are notoriously often out-of-stock.  classy companies won't throw the manufacturer under the bus to cover their behinds, which this company aparently does not do.  

further, it's funny that most of the negative reviews here are 1-reviewers (i.e. competiters trashing them with fake reviews).   how does a memory board ""break""?  lol.  keepin' it classy!

cris is friendly, fast and most importantly honest.  sorry if you don't like your quote or they tell you not to waste your money on a repair.  higly suggest for phoenix photographers."
940,"we had painters of the valley paint the exterior of our home.  they were professional, courteous, considerate of us and our property.  if they had a question about something they ask and just did not make decisions on their own.  we had a large amount of stucco patch. after the first coat they had us inspect with them to find any additional cracks and repaired them before the second coat.  they did an outstanding job and let our home in perfect condition.  daniel and his crew did a 5 star job."
941,"very quick response to our problem

we would highly recommend them to everyone"
942,came quick and was able to fix. would recommend for repairs. sadly need a new unit but he at least got it temporarily working.
943,"i contracted through lowes for an installation project and i had a couple other odd jobs. the representative who called me to schedule was very friendly and professional. on the day of the installation, i got a call an hour before the scheduled two-hour window to confirm the work so he could make sure he had correct parts. he got here a half hour earlier than scheduled, was very professional, knowledgeable and even did a repair on one of the jobs rather than a replacement. who does that? my experience has been that things are replaced and not repaired, which usually mean a bigger fee and he did an excellent clean up in the room where he worked on the larger project. i recommend around the clock plumbing."
944,"randall's does excellent work!

i have had prints done, had a broken frame repaired, and done multiple large custom framing projects at randall's.  everything has come out awesome.  friendly and knowledgable staff.

947,"marlon & his brother lucio were so helpful with our small roof repair! they were able to come do the work before our house closing deadline, when another company we had lined up canceled on us last minute.
lucio even went above and beyond by fixing a few dislodged tiles that he found. highly recommend!"
948,"i had some water damaged wood from the roof.  neil came out and gave me an estimate.  his estimate was significantly less than anyone else.
so i scheduled him to do the work.  he is honest, very professional,  on time and did an awesome job!  the charges were exactly as quoted. 
the wood needed to be replaced and neil actually told me if i wanted to paint it before he installs it (that way i didn't have to paint on a ladder above my head)  he would allow me to do so.  he also checked for cracked tiles on the roof and replaced the ones that were cracked without any extra charges. i highly recommend neil for any large or small roofing repairs. you will be very happy you hire him!!"
949,high quality work. very fast and honest about the job. i use stalling for refrigeration repair work all of the time. i wouldn't recommend anyone else.
950,"i got three estimates to replace our double garage door & install an opener on single garage door. the other two estimates were high, it seemed they added extra things on the estimate to make more $. when triple b came out, roderick looked for ways to save $ for me.  i scheduled the installation & everything went smooth. i am happy with the outcome. it looks & works great!  i recommend triple b to everyone who needs to replace or repair their garage doors."
951,"chris and his crew are top notch!  we just purchased a home that needed quite a bit of work.....from a full re-paint and color change, to drywall repair, drywall installation, texture, and caulking around all windows.  chris was prompt with coming out for an estimate, gave a great price, and his crew worked quickly and with attention to detail.  we will definitely be using them again in the future. i highly recommend stills construction!!"

958,"where to start, nothing but professionalism from this company. we originally signed up at the home show last year and have been nothing but satisfied. this year unfortunately the a/c went out and with the cost of repairs it would have been cheaper to buy a new one. instead of leaving us with no a/c for the hot weekend donnie did what he could do to make the a/c last, even said that he would call just incase the a/c needed a quick charge to hold us over. the a/c was supposed to be installed on a day that i was going to have to take off work, only to be given the great news that the a/c was in and someone was able to come down two days earlier and no vacation day having to be used. thank you for being great, honest, and professional. we now have an a/c company that we trust."
959,"fixed a classic gibson head stock repair me. even matched the white, which is very difficult to do. thanks guys!"
960,"i had a very little, but important job that i needed done.  ryan was extremely diligent in coming over to inspect and get my job squeezed in between other bigger, probably more lucrative jobs.  ryan treated my job as if i was the only client, with the largest job, and i am greatly appreciative of the attention he paid to making sure everything was completed timely, within budget and most importantly, it was repaired to the highest standard.  i would recommend ryan and the repair guys to anyone who needs a roofing company!"
961,"anthony was awesome!! the whole team over there know what they're doing! i was lost and needed someone to guide me on what to do with repairs and anthony not only explained in great detail about my armada, but worked with me on my budget!! my husband and i go here a lot and this is why!! thanks big o team!!"

965,"this place is a gem. i've been coming here for years before the renovation to expand seating. it's the best thai i've had outside of thailand, a close 2nd in cleveland is banana blossom in hingetown.

the curries are all excellent as well as the pad thai spicy style! their hot teas are also delightful, the ginger is just ginger root, sugar and water.. i appreciate the simplicity of it."
966,"their work is excellent! and they're pretty darn good about having it ready as promised. one annoyingly nice thing they've done is at times refuse to let me pay for a very very minor repair. 

i'm not recommending them because of that but i thought you should know they strive to go above and beyond for their customers"
967,"southwest garage doors was recommended by a friend and the recommendation was greatly appreciated. dan was prompt, friendly, and professional. our garage door lift had been seen and ""fixed"" by other repairmen but it wasn't until dan came that it was determined we needed a new lift. i wish we would have went with southwest first, it would have saved a lot of time and money. thanks dan for all your help!"
968,"i highly recommend this company for home inspections. will was very thorough in his inspection and provided a very detailed report that included pictures of what needed repairs. will was able to explain everything in terms that i could understand as well as ways these could be fixed. if you are looking for a company that will provide you with a very detailed inspection so that you don't end up with any surprises after purchasing, then this is the company to hire."
969,we hired rob to repair drywall and seal our front door.  he did a good job and seems like a really hard worker.  we would hire him again for other projects.
970,"one of the most respectful handyman i have met.   waiting for estimate.  jason is trustworthy, which is rare these days.   glad i found jason.  a dependable handyman is necessity if you're a homeowner with a bad hip replacement."

973,"due to recommendations on the community website in verrado i contacted ed and terri of clear view home inspections llc, as we were coming close to our 1 year move in date. not only is this company highly professional, the first thing ed found out is that we had a gas leak at our water heater. i called our meritage home rep who sent the company who installed the water heater to repair the leak within 15 minutes. kudos to meritage..!! we paid $335.00 for our home inspection, which lasted 3 1/2 hours, 2560 sq ft home, but finding the gas leak may have saved our lives let alone the house..!! there were no major problems in our home once the inspection was completed. the inspection gave us a piece of mind that our home was safe and well built.
i highly recommend clear view home inspections."
974,"johnny saved the day for me after our nest thermostat installation didn't go according to plan. after an hour of trying to troubleshoot, i called johnny and he walked me through it within 5 minutes. this is the 3rd time i've used him for ac tune up & repair so i highly recommend."

976,these guys are great. they've repaired my old truck when it needs it.  it's old and nickle and diming me to death. will return when needed. they are very dilagent and they don't price gouge like others in the area. ole
977,used this firm to paint three rooms and two baths. they used sherwin williams on the walls and mautz white on the ceilings. also had two drywall repairs one was extensive. all seems ok at this writing. i must add that the star of the job was the dude on stilts which negated ladders for him.
978,"i've been coming here for the past 5 years or so (before the recent renovation) for my american spirit cigarettes and find the prices to be the most reasonable.  employees adam and hannah take a genuine interest in customer satisfaction.  there is a diverse selection of items at this location (cigarettes, cigars, specialty items, etc.) and something here for everyone!"

983,"for the last few years, my wife and i were thinking of stopping by the wildlife world zoo & aquarium, and today with us both having a day off, we made this a reality.  then again, after initially seeing mixed reviews on yelp, we skeptical about going, but we are very glad we did.  it was certainly a fun way to spend a day.

first, the zoo is huge!  there are so many different areas from the aquarium, dragonworld, safari park, adventure land, and so much more.  we arrived around 12:30 pm on a thursday afternoon knowing we had 5-6 hours to enjoy the park.  a bus of children left as we were arriving.  at that point, it seemed like we had the park to ourselves (along with a few other couples and families).  almost all animals were literally feet away from us.  we also could feed many of the animals for only 50 cents per handful of feed.  i fed the giraffes!!!  some fun notes about the animals:  the parrots really spoke and sounded like people, there is an adorable alpaca at the petting zoo, and they have three white rhinos that are endangered.  initially, we were worried about the small enclosures that the animals are in; while some still seem to be quite small, we were relieved to know that some are much larger than they appeared.  

there are some great rides from rides that will get you from one point to another (ie. train, tram, and sky ride) and others that are just fun (swing ride, zip line, scooter ride, log flume ride, and others).  the train and tram actually go through some of the animal enclosures!  only three rides were open today.  we chose not to ride any, in part to everything having a cost associated with it, but then again, rides at most zoos have a cost, too.  what we did go to (that was included in the cost of admission) were the shows:  the wildlife encounters show and the sea lion show at the aquarium.  both were great!  similar to the animals in general, almost every animal we met were literally feet away from us.  some animals (like the peacocks) just randomly wander around the park.  

also, unlike other zoos, it is very expensive to go to this zoo.  it's $39.99 + tax per adult and $19.99 + tax per child (3-12).  children 2 & under are free.  this rate includes both the zoo and aquarium.  on the other hand, there are plenty of coupons and discounts including group rates, aaa discount, and weekly senior discount.  we used the entertainment book (http://entertainment.com), which had a bogo coupon for both the wildlife world zoo and another bogo coupon for the dillons bbq restaurant onsite (value of up to $15).  we did learn that the bogo for the zoo in the physical entertainment book was only valued at $24 while the one online that we could print was valued at $39.  the book itself was much less expensive than what we saved today at the zoo alone!

while the layout of the zoo and aquarium made sense and were easy to navigate, there were many animals that you could find in multiple places within the park.  the park itself also can use some renovations, which hopefully it will get all in good time.  while we've never been at this zoo on a weekend, i trust that there are many more people there along with most of the rides being open.  if you haven't been to this zoo before, i definitely recommend it!"
984,"these guys are not only fast ( i had to have a hole dug in my kitchen because of pipe) i never thought the repairs would work (old house) let alone be so fast, and tidy. truth is, i always switched plumbers due to bad experiences, finally i have a plumbing company that actually helps you and does the job. as a woman dealing with contractors you normally figure they are going to bs you - not these guys they actually help you. and go out of their way to get the job done affordably. i cannot thank them enough for making a stressful situation easy"
985,"update--- justin sent new repair men who completed an excellent job fixing the previous mistakes and now everything looks new again, if i didn't know there was damage, i wouldn't be able to find it.  the stucco repair man was very professional, i would use him again.  thank you justin for correcting this issue!"

1008,"did you know wrigley's gum was the first product to have a bar code on the packaging?  now you know.

being born and raised in phoenix, i have always heard of wrigley mansion but have never been to it.  all this changed when we had a chance to help photograph a wedding here!  

as to be expected, the grounds of wrigley mansion are gorgeous.  you drive up a windy pathway, give your keys to valet, and enter through majestic doors with a juliet balcony set right above  it.  the first thing you see is the grand staircase, the high dome ceilings, and a beautiful chandelier.  we had arrived early and the coordinator encouraged us to explore the grounds.  we walked through many hallways, inspected some fireplaces, looked into gigantic mirrors, critiqued some creepy artwork, poked our heads into rooms with amazing views overlooking the greater phoenix area, peered into rooms with spooky atmospheres [especially the pink bridal suite!  yikes!], et cetera.  we even traipsed through the garden area and ooh'd and ahh'd over the views of nearby mountains.  i can see why this is such a popular venue.  the view is what you pay for.  geordie's was closed as well as the rest of the mansion this past weekend but i believed they re-opened to the public yesterday.

all in all, this place could use a little love in terms of renovation but everything is great!"
1009,"i hired nick to remodel my 1/2 bath and i can't get over how awesome it looks. he is a total professional and i would definitely hire him again. in fact he will be my go-to-guy for any future projects. nick is reliable and easy to work with, if you need any renovations to your home, you want nick. aaaa++++ contractor!!"

chris completed our inspection, did a walk through with us and patiently answered all our questions.  he took photos of all necessary repairs for us to send to the sellers agent.  due to having photo documentation they agreed to fix every necessary repair!  i am very happy with chris's experience and professionalism and would highly recommend home pride inspections."

we had a large plumbing issue in our condo. the cast iron pipes that drain all our plumbing in our master bathroom were cracked and needed to be repair. damon and his intern nathan came and did an outstanding job! they did everything they could to not destroy our newly remodeled unit to access these pipes. damon is an incredibly skilled plumber and the got the job done in one day (he had to replace three cast iron drain pipes). the best part about working with damon is he will try his absolute hardest to not have to damage your stuff in order to access the pipes. he saved our shower (didn't cut into it as most plumbers would have), our kitchen cabinets (went around even though it made his job harder), and also our vanity (just cut behind it without having to rip it out - most plumbers would have just ripped it out). 10 out of 10 would recommend! and be sure to ask for damon, i promise you will not be disappointed!"
1026,"after our home warranty refused to fix our issue, justin came out today to meet my husband to help repair some plumbing. he is prompt, very friendly, down to earth, honest, and is obviously a hardworking business owner. very professional with fair pricing. we will definitely keep his information for future plumbing needs and will recommend justin to everyone we know."

1031,"i received several other quotes and all were much higher then desert landscape lighting. all the other 
people, electricians, handyman and other landscape lighting people told me the transformer 
was broken and had to be replaced. sam came and opened it up and said it was fine so i gave home the job.   he did the job quickly and efficiently and on budget almost half of other quotes. one larger company quoted me almost 8 times the amount 
he charged for the job.     it is difficult to find 
honest, reliable people in this town and sam is definitely one of them. give him a shot you won't be disappointed."
1032,"just had my hvac repaired, he did a great job. kind and helpful. will recommend  to any one."
1033,"barbara turns from designer kitchen and baths went above and beyond to help me with repairs to a leaking shower that was well past any normal warranty period. i mean way, way, way past a time frame that any other contractor would honor. 


when the shower started leaking through the wall a handyman had come in as a favor to me and quite honestly made a mess of things by ripping both shower tiles, the shower surround, and a water damaged cabinet out.  when he saw how involved repairs would be he suggested i call the original installer.  it had been so many years since installation i had not even considered calling designer kitchens and baths.

barbara came out and was so kind.  i am a 100% disabled veteran on a very limited income.  she only charged me the cost of whatever materials were needed for repair.  labor was free on both the shower and the repair/re-installation of the adjoining side wood cabinet. this saved me thousands.

barbara also sent her repairmen to help me with other issues in the house at a very reasonable cost.  i am so thankful that she came to my aid when my chips were down.

designer kitchen and bath gets an a++++++++ rating from me."
1034,"i first went to universal stone several years ago to spruce up a small bathroom. i met nicki there and she was extremely helpful. from pointing out to me that they had remnant pieces of granite where i could save some money and then put those savings into my master bath that i planned on doing. when it came down to getting that done the job was amazing! the team they have there is efficient and very professional. when it came down to my master bathroom renovation they exceeded my expectations! i have since then sold my home and am planning a kitchen, and 2 bathroom renovation. i can't wait until we get going with another project. thank you to the universal stone team!"
1035,"after getting a quote from another repairman for a new ac unit, we called evans for a second opinion.  thank goodness we did!!  evans responded quickly, checked our ac unit, making a few valve adjustments.  our ac was working just fine.  that was three years ago.  our ac unit is inspected by evans every year and is working like new.  evans are honest people that will give you an honest evaluation."
1036,these guys are great and reliable. always on time and very detailed orientated when it comes to explaining their  repair recommendations.
1037,"i can't say enough good things about this company.  we have been a customer for years and have not had one bad experience.  the technicians are the face of the company and are knowledgeable, polite and honest.  they always shoot straight with you and never try and sell you unneeded repairs or replacements.  i used to keep track of my technician's name to request them the next time but as they were promoted or moved on, many others have come out.  literally every technician has been outstanding."
1038,jason did a great job installing my new closet racking and a barn door in my master bedroom. i will definitely hire him again for other jobs and i recommend him to anyone looking for a good handyman.

1051,"had my home inspected yesterday. the inspector nicola was friendly, knowledgeable and  professional at all times. in approximately within two hours he had my home completely inspected from top to bottom. he showed me pictures of  areas that needed minor repairs . i would highly recommend home pride inspections to anyone in need of home inspection whether it be a buyer or seller."
1052,"hector, the owner was very respectful and nice. he did everything he could to get me lowest price on my bumper  repair. they finished the job in just one day and did a great job. definitely recommend bumperdoc and it's awesome they support military, vets, and officers!"

1054,"this company has excellent communication- he was honest and didn't try to sell me on a new fence ( which i was expecting to pay for ) he said all i needed were new posts . he was reliable, called immediately after i requested a call and even bumped my appt up so i can get the repair done sooner because my home was hitting the market !"
1055,"after having 2 other ac repair companies out, $400+ and lots of frustration my ac unit was still not working properly.   i called mojave following a recommendation by a neighbor.  i sure wish i would have found them sooner.  it would have saved me $, time & frustration.   i called them today and they had someone out about 1/2 hr later.   donnie the tech was very professional & knowledgable. he had my unit working great.  no overselling, just fixed the problem.  i highly recommend!"

1058,"we recently completed a large renovation using summit.  i would highly recommend them for any job large or small.  from mario the lead fabricator who worked his magic on difficult slabs to omar and ray along with their assistants who meticulously installed each counter and stone floor....this was an exemplary job by professionals! clayton, miles and stevie work together to create a trustworthy business that we've come to count on! this is just one example of a collective body of work that turned out beautifully!  thank you summit tile and stone for our lovely remodel that everyone there made special for us!"

1060,awesome experience working with these guys. they gave an accurate estimation of the work involved by just looking at pictures of the project. they came in and knocked the whole thing out same day and even found some other issues without trying to upsell me on more costly repairs. would definitely use these guys again and would highly recommend to a friend.
1061,"the company provided a quick response and the repairman, ej, was pleasant and did a great job as he always does."
1062,i knew i was dealing with a pro when randy was able to locate the problem within 60 seconds of me pointing and explaining in layman's terms about the gusher coming from my aged sprinkler system. an hour later he had replaced the problem lines and fixed the leak. i'm sure i will recoup what i paid for the repair in savings on my water bill.
1063,"we called dave jones in as a second opinion on an ac unit, which would fail every twelve months.  the tech knew the product line and knew of the factory recall on the issue which caused the failure.  he made arrangements with the factory and distributor for the repair.
in my experience, an equipment repair is useless unless we know and fix the cause of the failure.  dave jones thinks the same way and got to the heart of the matter to find the solution.  we could not have asked for better in all areas including skill, knowledge, resources, task completion, follow-up, and cost.
just wow.  super!  we could not be more satisfied."
1064,"bark ave was amazing. they got me in, in less than a hour 1 1/2 after i called them this morning and they were friendly, informative and above all compassionate.  bark ave repaired the damage done by 1st pet.  i'm so glad i found these guys!"
1065,"if you use anyone else you're nuts!!
these guys are the best!!
i asked them to help me with a roof test because anderson windows continually thought it was our roof making a coupled windows leak.
ryan and kyle came out and did a proper water roof test and proved it wasn't the roof.
anderson windows roofing contractor came alone and i don't think i saw a ladder in his truck. wth!?!?
anyways, the repair guys are fabulous, honest and knows how to do things right!!!
thank you ryan and kyle. this has been a frustrating year dealing with anderson windows."
1066,vien repaired a garage egress door and replaced the exterior stoop. work was done in a professional manner with creativity and  attention to detail.  the cost was in line with the value of the project.
1067,"we contacted asap restoration to come and check out a ""musty"" odor in our home that we had just purchased, wanting to make sure black mold was not an issue.   joshua rudin, the owner, personally came out to the our home.   he is the most diligent person we've met in a long time, going the extra mile and following up (even on small details to which most others would not give a second thought). joshua  has truly gone out of his way to make sure our home was safe, and has given us good advice on avoiding costly repairs  some of which he stood to make a profit, had he advised those repairs.  other less business owners and companies  might have recommended the repairs, but asap restoration did not. because of his integrity and thoroughness, i would call asap restoration first, should we need them in the future."
1068,"richard at big o is awesome! i needed my headlight replaced, he said there was no charge for labor. when they started working on it and saw there was more work to it than they thought, he honored what he had told me and didn't charge for the labor! nothing worse than finding out your repair is more than you were told so i definitely appreciated it. thanks, richard!"
1069,alex is great. i'm selling my house and the buyer requested a few electrical repairs. i requested quotes on yelp and alex was one of the first to respond. he gave a reasonable estimate and did a great job. i'd definitely recommend arc electrical.
1070,"i have used them numerous times and the work was always done very quickly and professionally. they even repaired a tear in a leather nfl team jacket so that it is all but invisible.  they are a little out of my way, but i happily make the trip."
1071,"hd restoration was great when we had a leak in our roof that had to be rebuilt. they ended up coming right on time and completing the work properly (being timely is huge for me as schedule is tight with work). the only issue we had was their painter left a mess everywhere even with using a tarp. we had paint specks all over our door, tile and wall. they also dinged our cabinet door in the guest bathroom. however the owner did reach out and try to make it right through repairs and clean-up. i would recommend this restoration/rebuild company again, just make sure you keep and eye out on some of the work to double check."
1072,"great location, great facility, good people who run this place.  i appreciate the renovation too.  i just need to find time to go there more often."
1073,always has been my favorite casino since it opened. has gone down a bit in the past 5 years. love the new renovations hopefully it can reestablish itself.  nightclub crowd is horrible though

1082,"jimmy did an awesome job fixing the lumpy walls in our house!
we have a 100+ year old lakewood house with plaster walls that have set and bowed over time. jimmy was very responsive, and professional. he came out for an estimate and then did the repair work over two days. he was respectful and cleaned up after himself which is more than i can say for other contractors i've hired... i will definitely be using jimmy for future projects around my house!"
1083,"shannon and wayne erting are very professional, timely and do superb work.  they cleaned and repaired 1150 sq ft of travertine, used a high gloss, and grouted with very white grout.  and it looks fabulous!!!!! i absolutely love my floors and highly recommend shannon and wayne."
1084,we called heiser heating & ac this morning and they came out within two hours of us calling them. they found a work-around that is allowing our house to be cooled off while parts arrive so they can do the real repair.
1085,"what a great guy jeff is. i'm a property manager and tenants are not happy when they have to wait for repairs. i called a few companies right at the end of business and they all turned me down. i finally chose dreikosen as a last attempt because his zip code was near the property. i could tell he was probably done for the day but when i told him the property was in his zip code he quickly decided he could do it. he got there fast and made a tenant very happy. i was very impressed by him, his professionalism and willingness to help me. he has a new customer now!"
1086,"i had a great experience with homer the handyman!  i was quoted $340 to fix a leaky bathtub faucet, patch and paint a hole in the wall, replace and paint a broken door, re-caulk two bathtubs, and fix various broken drawers around the house.  the man who did the work, evelio, was extremely competent, courteous and professional.  i always feel like i'm taking a gamble when it comes to using a business like this- you never know what you are going to get from a google search... but i guess i lucked out.  i would recommend evelio at homer the handyman to anyone.  he truly knew what he was doing and made the work seem effortless.  the paint and texture of the patched hole in the wall matched perfectly and you couldn't even tell it was there.  the new door was perfect too.  no more leaky bathtub faucet either.  i was very satisfied with the work done and pleasantly surprised that i was only charged what i was quoted for the work and not a penny more, despite running into a few speed bumps in which evelio was quickly able to adjust to.  i will definitely be calling homer the handyman again when the need arises!"
1087,"i am going to do this review in sections. 
i called jim and he came to the house next day. he is always nice and pleasant to be with.
we signed the paper and he said i was next and he will start next week. next week came and went with no call. took 2weeks before i got the call. i won't take a star cuz i used to be a tile contractor and sometimes jobs take longer.
the crew came today and we talked about how i would like to live while the damage repair goes on.  no arguing, just work. they made a great plastic wall so i have my side and they have theirs.  so far, 5 stars.

 3 and i can't find anything wrong with these guys.. polite workaholics.. still 5 stars."
1088,i love that they take pictures of what they recommend to be repaired! belt was cracked and sure enough the pic he provided showed a very badly cracked belt!
1089,troy and his team did a fine job on my 1971 firebird. from rescuing me within minutes from the side of the road on two occasions to keeping my repairs as cost friendly for me as possible. i truly trust this team and would highly reccomend!

1093,the gentleman that came out to fix my washer was polite and efficient. cleaned up after himself and cleaned the area after the repair.  the operator that handled the scheduling confirmed everything and was really nice. i would be happy if they came out to fix anything else.
1094,"fast, friendly and reasonable prices. i brought my husbands suits in to be cleaned and repair a few spots. they did a great job!!"
1095,"i highly recommend the garage door kings.  i called a lot of different places, and everyone had different quotes, and time schedules - - and out of all of them, none asked me many questions to help determine what was going on with my door.  i called garage door kings and spoke with bill - he immediately sympathized and started asking questions to trouble shoot as best as he could what could possibly be the problem with the door.  needless to say, i was impressed.  in order to get a full idea of what was going on with my door, he came out the same day, inspected the door, and spent time explaining the issue.  he repaired my door, and it's amazing!! my door has never operated so well! extremely fair and honest. i will be recommending him to others."
1096,"i will never get a title loan from any other location in town! i needed some emergency cash for some home repairs. i don't have much established credit at all so getting financed for any loan from a bank is such a chore. i went into presto, they were so nice, helpful, and it didn't take much more than 30 mins to complete the whole process. i got exactly what i needed with no issues!"
1097,joe is awesome he built my sons a fabulous tree house. he typical does remodels/renovations but i saw his previous work and had to ask if he would build our tree house. thank you joe!!!!! see a pic of the tree house at its beginning stage. i will try to post more of the finished product.

1103,"matt was great to work with. he responded quickly to my request for an appointment in ahwatukee, and got out quickly since my main water line was broken and leaking badly. he couldn't do the major repair the day he visited, but he immediately got water to the house working temporarily until he could return to do the whole job a few days later. including having to cut the driveway to get a line from the street to the house, there was also a fair amount of landscape ""tear up"". matt and his crew got everything looking great again before they left, and it felt really good working with someone so professional and trustworthy. i definitely recommend mountain park plumbing and will use them again!"
1104,"very professional, prompt and great communication. will definitely refer to anyone who need garage repairs."

1107,these guys really know their stuff.  very good selection of used equipment and always expert repairs.
1108,i had a great experience with lovetts. they performed quality repair work in a timely manner and i trusted their expertise. thank you!
1109,"great place! fresh oysters.. and only for a dollar!.. great vibe and great venue,  love the renovations!"
1110,"this place is great.  i filled out their online form, hit the send button and i got a call from mike within a few minutes.  i got a price and we set up an appointment for repair of all four wheels on my audi.  the appointment was set up in just a couple days from the time i spoke with mike.  ryan showed up on time and did a fabulous job.  my wheels now look new.  very nice company to deal with.  i will use them again.  highly recommended."
1111,"high quality repair and done while i waited for it!  i'm really happy with the ""premium"" glass upgrade that i paid a little extra for.  the guys there were very knowledgeable and friendly."
1112,"had a problem with my disposal, and red truck handyman came out right away on a friday night. fixed the problem quickly. plus, they were very friendly, and got the job done quickly. and very reasonably priced!i'm glad i found them on yelp, and would highly recommend them for any handyman jobs! thanks steve."
1113,"i am beyond amazed at how fast, reliable, ethical and amazing this company is!!!! after having mediocre electrical work done by another contractor, this company came out almost immediately and repaired a ceiling fan and oven connection.  their window was only one hour to arrive at the house instead of 4-6 like other companies.  the price was more than fair.  maurice was clean, friendly and extremely professional.  i have found my electricians!!! thank you simple electric! i am impressed!"
1114,the handymannextdoor does great work.  they are always very prompt and get the job done right! they're  very professional!  kerry is always quick to return calls if he doesn't pick up on the first time! i definitely would hire them again!!!
1115,"steve has repaired two problems at my rental.  the first was a shower that was leaking onto the downstairs ceiling and the second was the ceiling!  both jobs were completed when he said they would be and the workmanship was perfect!!  the ""cherry"" on the top was when steve told me that the shower would be less to fix than what he had originally quoted!!!  who does that now-a-days??!!  now that's a good person!"
1116,it's been quite a while since repairs were made on my oversized double garage door and i can honestly say that the work and professionalism was well done. i would definitely contact garage doors 4 less again without hesitation!
1117,"i called around several places to get a small cracked pane of glass replaced and these guys quoted me half as much to do the work as some of the others. they were able to come out quickly, the repairman showed up on time, he was super friendly and efficient. i highly recommend mdr glass and will definitely use them again in the future."
1118,"excellent experience today. woke up to my rear window broken out. called and spoke with jose. he was very friendly and professional. he gave me a reasonable estimate and said he could be at my home to complete the repair within 1-1.5 hrs. they showed up right on time, and completed the repair quickly. i was charged exactly what was quoted. new window looks great."
1119,"these guys are great.  i've used them to move my table across the city and again to disassemble and reassemble the table for some repair work.  mcclain, darcy, and q are always on time and professional.  q left me with some great advice on ways to keep my table in prime condition.  

can't recommend them enough."
1120,i contacted the company through the yelp app and received a response within 5 minuets. i received a quote and asked when they could come out to repair my garage door. i was pleasantly surprised that they were able to come the same day. the technician arrived within an hour and fix my door. i highly recommend this company and will be calling them again if i need my door fixed.
1121,"super fast and cheap repairs . julio is the guy to call! he was fast and knew what was wrong the instant he saw my air. only paid 150 compared to other ""highly top"" companies they were trying to charge me 200 and up! me and my husband were so satisfied will keep calling him for any other problem in the future. i highly recommend them! another satisfied customer!!"
1122,"i called in the afternoon and had a technician at my home the same day. he not only repaired both of the garage doors but installed a new opener where there had not been one previously.  he, jeff, was super friendly and efficient. got everything done in just over an hour. i would highly recommend this company."
1123,john was extremely professional and educated me so much more on how the actual repair works. it's definitely all about where you go! fast and friendly! :) definitely recommended!
1124,"everything was clean and in good repair. beds comfortable, and very quiet room. would return."
1125,"best hi end repairs!
great selection of vintage hi end audio
bought many items and had repairs done
bobby always comes through!"
1126,"we purchased a sofa a year ago. it was getting a bit squeaky so we called to have it repaired.
the repairman showed up promptly and fixed it in a short amount of time. it's like new again."
1127,"these guys did a fabulous job.  easy to work with, cleaned up all debris when done and was more than helpful in many ways.  well informed. they went out of there way to repair and patch things former paints did not bother with.
i highly recommend paint pro's. great job team."
1128,bobby & crew are the best when it comes to high end and vintage audio repair. easy to work with and extremely knowledgeable the guys at audio xpert are your go to guys in las vegas for any home audio repair.
1129,"james has done a number of repairs for us over the years and we've always been happy with the end results.  we've found him to be very reliable, polite and professional.  he shows up when he says he will and gets the job done quickly and correctly.  highly recommended."
1130,"i feel so stupid. we had been using another guy for years. i mean years. we will never call him again. jeff was terrific and fixed what was wrong for a very minimal charge. what was wrong was ""fixed"" by the other guy for a butt-load of money. it's hard to find an honest repair person...but thanks to yelp we found jeff."
1131,"love the renovation,
the casino is ""warming and inviting""  if there is such a thing....
easy access to the strip, well located, tons to choose from to eat."
1132,"revision: the rooms have undergone the much-needed renovations and are a lot more presentable. with last minute bookings apps, i am still getting 2013 rates as of 2017, or in other words super cheap."
1133,this review is based on the work provided by myles. we had two under-slab hot water leaks and myles and his men repaired them both. the bottom line is that we had a disaster on our hands and he fixed it! we now have our plumber for life! the best!
1134,"richard (i assume the owner) was responsive to what i needed, and turned around my small electrical/solder job sooner than i expected.  reasonable pricing, too.  this is my new go-to place for circuit board repair."
1135,"robert mason came out to look at a house that i was looking to buy. he was able to locate a potentially expensive roofing issue and advised that i have a roofer come out to look further into it, which i am in the process of doing, to determine how serious (expensive) it might be.

his report was thorough and easy to follow, complete with detailed pictures. i'll be using it as a tool to either renegotiate with the seller and/or as a basis to potentially walk away if repairs are refused by seller. he explained everything to me as we went through and put it into terms that i was able to understand since i am a first time home buyer. as many reviews pointed out, and i agree with, he is very detailed and personable. if i end up walking away from my deal i'll be using him on my next one for sure."
1136,it has been a pleasure working with regan and his team. anderson roofing & repair is one of the better roofing companies in the scottsdale area that recommend.  thank you again.
1137,"ha is the best around. my family and i have been going to ha for many, many years now, and i will never go anywhere else. (we have multiple honda's, lexus, and toyota.) ha is always honest about what needs repair, does a fantastic job, and more than fair. i cannot say enough good things about this business."
1138,"it's amazing what melissa and her group can accomplish in a short amount of time. they are truly experts with methods that work. so far, they have been helping me with a garage full of years of clutter and inherited things from family that have passed. i have been working with dj, who is an amazing organizer and handyman as well. he is not only fast and efficient, but also patient and kind. dj and melissa are making a difficult task easy and approachable. i highly recommend them!"
1139,"my ac stopped working...which is a bad thing in the middle of the az summer.  i had a ac repairman come the next morning and the result was a diagnosis of a fried power line.  he didn't know the state of the wire and thought a new conduit from the panel up the wall and then through the attic would be best- for $2,000.  i thought i should get a second opinion.  i called simple and although their earliest availability was two days later, they were able to squeeze me in that same afternoon.  within an hour, the problem was diagnosed, a connector replaced, and my ac is now working.  sure, there could have been other issues with the unit that could have required an ac tech...but in this case i had an electrician do an electrician's work.  simple was more than prompt, very reasonable, and highly recommended."
1140,"so i have to say, as somebody who works in the business, i was exceptionally impressed. the renovations are amazing! they are high-end and contemporary, but still fit the neighborhood feel. the community areas are all over the place! it's walkable to a ton of dining and entertainment. all in all, this is an amazing addition to the revitalization of the neighborhood."
1141,came in for repair work on the muffler system on our 1989 toyota corolla and also had them repair a bad front axel. great staff and repair was fast and done correctly the first time.
1142,"this one is very well run. alexis at the front desk is hilarious! she said they are mostly sold out sunday through wednesday. not difficult to understand given the quality of the renovation, and the outstanding staff. 

i'm a platinum premiere member, and marriott properties are always my first choice, this one is one of the best run courtyards i have stayed in."
1143,"hanging art is a skill it is not a handyman project. i learned that lesson a long time ago. scott has been installing and hanging art at my offices for years. then i asked him to help me select, position and hang art at my home in phoenix. what a difference! besides a proper installation, the placement made the house look so much better that i became an instant believer in the added value of proper art display by professionals. 
the installs have always been first class and the price very reasonable. 
highly and unequivocally recommended for art installation and positioning"
1144,"my trusted place to take my 2006 mustang always feel vip treatment. transportation is provided, professional, and they stand behind all there work. i did have a problem with the work on some repairs, the shocks weren't put on but the manager sold them at cost. i had my husband install them. 
but i did have many other simple repairs needed. this was perfect. so i feel if you have a problem give people a chance to make it right first. if so i understand we all can make a mistake. 
i"
1145,"i have used super cleaners for over 5 years and they have consistently done a great job and always delivered on my special requests. clothes are ready on time, cleaned and pressed properly and they can fix any repairs needed as well."
1146,"scott and tim are incredible inspectors. they not only thoroughly inspected an older townhouse for us, they provided an incredibly detailed report via pdf complete with photos of their findings, recommendations, and wonderful organization. all within 36 hours! they were perfectly on time for their appointment and completed the inspection in remarkable time as they worked as a team. with their help and detailed report, we negotiated a $1500 repair credit above and beyond the below market value we had negotiated with the seller!!! we recommend them to anyone buying a house. 

also - they referred a wonderful termite inspector/exterminator to us at an incredible rate that we intend to keep as our bug guy. thanks scott and tim! we'll be in touch when we buy another property!"
1147,"love the ceviche (pescado and mixto) here, very authentic! 

they recently underwent a renovation, it looks very lovely in there. the blue and white colour scheme and removal of the side bar really opens up the restaurant and lets more light in."
1148,"i have worked with many realtors over the years, and i've never had such easy and worry-free experiences as when i have worked with christine and her team. christine goes far above and beyond what i would expect from a realtor, and it makes working with her so enjoyable. she sold a condo for me and helped me find a house. once i had purchased the home, she also helped me find a contractor to do renovations, and co-ordinated meetings and visits from various trades people as i do not live in the city. not only is christine extremely knowledgeable, she is a lot of fun to work with. i would recommend her to anyone looking for a top-notch realtor!"
1149,"dave and his crew do a great job everytime we have called them. they can do any type of home repair and they do it on time. i highly recommend house boy, they have been working on my house for over 10 years!"
1150,this has been my spot when i just have a craving for taco bell over del taco.  the new renovation is gaudy yet i always had my order spot and the meals prepared are generous. the place from inside and out including the rest room remains clean.  personnel are good too.
1151,this company fixed my garbage disposal earlier today and did a great job! both the person i made the appointment and repair person were friendly and professional. the repair person was punctual and my disposal replaced within 45 minutes. i'd definitely use them again.
1152,"a 1 is sent out by ahs. the technician is professional and very knowledgeable. ken, the tech, was a second opinion and he evaluated my 20 year old dishwasher that the first company failed to repair. 
ken knew what part was necessary, ordered it and returned within a week to install the new part. 
ken is a straight talker who knows his business and better than that he knows how to get things done. 
i have had many ahs techs come out for many years now and a-1, and ken are as good as you will get."
1153,"i emailed second opinion late at night and very early the following morning i received a call regarding a hot water heater repair that was needed. the little bit of information i provided gave them a good idea of what was wrong and sure enough, they diagnosed it accurately (broken pressure valve).

the tech arrived, determined immediately what the issue was and began working on the repair. the repair was done quickly, the work was done professionally and all was fixed. great work and recommended!"
1154,"eli the handyman switched out some bathroom fixtures for me. including the vanities, sinks, faucets, mirrors and light. the men who came out where on time, courteous and did great work. will definitely use them again."
1155,had a very complicated hernia repair here on 5/22. i have stayed in presbeteryan and shadyside before...both excellent drs and staff...here is good..but not as good as the other too. still better than my local hospitals.
1156,"i cannot say enough about this company.  there is simply nothing they can't fix...and if they can't fix it, they will find someone who can fast.  my husband and i bought a second home in scottsdale recently and it was empty for quite a while and needed lots of tlc.  fix it floyd was recommended by our realtor and we cannot be more happy with this company.  they are professional, nice, courteous and do not know what ""no"" means!!  they can do electrical, plumbing, granite counters....pretty much anything!! they will be the only  company we call when we need something fixed, repaired, installed or built!!"
1157,"this review is for rc willey's response to my one star review only. they expressed genuine concern, and repaired the recliner at my earliest convenience."
1158,"fabulous!  denise and her staff are amazing.  i went to them with a challenge--fix a broken plastic motorcycle tail light and turn signal assembly that is no longer available.  they repaired it with a fiberglass-type material, filled in the missing parts, sanded and shaped it and repainted it, and it's better than new!  they took on the project as a challenge even though it was a complete shot in the dark that it would work.  great people, excellent work, honest and friendly--the very best!"
1159,"i've had turn two do regular maintenance and repairs twice now, and both times it was an extremely pleasant experience."
1160,"tip top is the best!  mike, the owner, is professional, courteous, and an outstanding repairman."
1161,this place is fantastic from beginning to end. the staff is great and the place is clean and inviting. they kept me informed of the progress along the way and did an amazing job on the repair. highly recommended.
1162,"james was extremely quick, helpful, and professional. he knew i was pressed for time when he came out to repair my dryer and was in and out in 20 minutes. he even found $20 when he opened up the dryer. he could've kept it and i wouldn't have ever known. great work ethics! i would definitely refer him."
1163,"brad came out to diagnose why my bbq island was not getting power to the outside fridge and the outlets . 
first of all he was on time and was friendly.
after checking almost all the outlets and gfi units in the house he finally located the problem. 
it took him an hour to source out the issue but he persisted and eventually found some disconnected wires at a gfi unit and discovered  the little fridge was on the fritz . 
all repairs were made.
i would recommend brad for his persistence and ability to solve mysterious issues ."
1164,you will not find better technicians for high end or vintage audio repair in vegas or the southwest us in my opinion.  i will not take my mcintosh anywhere else.
1165,"did a great, fast, reliable job on my brake repair. couldn't ask for more!"
1166,"professional, on time, neat and good workmanship. i have used these guys twice already for roof repairs. a tree from the woods on my property landed on the roof and damaged my gutter last year. they worked with me, and fixed it in a timely fashion. cannot tell any difference from the original gutter that was installed. its a small job, but they were great about it. another tree fell on my roof from neighbors property and did some serious damage (i learned in sc that its an act of god and they are not responsible) wth??? again, they took the job as it was relatively small, and did the work. this one was an emergency as i had 2 holes in the roof and water was coming in when it rained. they knew i was in a bind to get it fixed and they were very fair about the price and timing to complete the work."
1167,"dave drew is just excellent! i had him install a towel bar, fix a drain problem and repair an exterior patio ceiling. the ceiling is drywall and the tape was peeling. all of the tape, mud and paint had to come down. replacing all that stuff was a tedious, 3-4 hour job. when dave finished, it looked brand new. he is absolutely meticulous, and very reasonable.

if you need work done, you won't do better than dave."
1168,"i have used one guard for our home, and a couple of rentals homes that we own. they have always been quick and prompt with any repair requests that have been needed. when we have had problems with air conditioning, they were fast to respond and repair. i have heard about other companies making clients wait so long to get the job done, even up to a month! it's so easy to use their online system if you need to put in a claim, or just have any other questions or concerns. i refer them to all my buyers'!"
1169,"i live in cornelius and this is one of our favorite places to eat. they closed for renovations and said they would reopen in late october. as of this writing, they are still not open so not sure if they will reopen or not?! so bummed."
1170,"i have never felt so good about calling a plumber!  jose was competent, courteous and genuinely helpful.  his innovative and quick problem solving made a potentially time consuming repair turn into one that got my water running in no time.  i will definitely call them in the future.  thank you!"
1171,"it's true that repairs at audio wizard take a while, but it's worth the wait to get your cherished high quality equipment working and making the beautiful sounds you've missed. thanks to gary for work on my gear."
1172,"called them on a sunday at 2:20pm, technician arrived by 3:15. he was friendly and diagnosed the problem, gave me an estimate and it was fixed by 4:15. i would recommend them, i appreciate the speed and quality of the repair. the house feels great."
1173,"absolutely the best paint and body repair ever! recently damaged the rear bumper of our infiniti. visited with jason lejeune  who gave me an estimate and time frame for the repairs. repairs were completed on time and at the estimated cost. 
the paint repair is flawless!
thanks jason ! thank you zack!"
1174,"larry hempen is a real find... trustworthy and efficient.  i called him in the morning to help with a fence repair on our duplex, and by the end of the day we were done.  very reasonable, and a nice guy.  we will definitely call him again!"
1175,"currently closed for renovations. a bit disappointed, but looking forward to a new facelift"
1176,"i was very happy to get adrian to come and install my garage door opener for me. he informed me on what condition my garage door was in and what i needed to do for maintenance and upkeep.  he did not try to pressure or up sell me any of the products.  he is honest and explains thoroughly step by step.  i would definitely recommend him when it comes to garage door opener installation, maintenance or repair."
1177,"we had a new central air unit put in last month after a check up on our new home proved it was needed. we appreciated photos that were taken to show us exactly what was going on, the man that came to our house was terrific. they were able to put it in the next day, but then we waited a month to have the attic entrance repaired. we were getting discouraged i won't lie, then juan showed up at our door. he worked quickly and did beautiful work, thank you so much for finding such great employees they make all of the difference!"
1178,"blind repair....ask how much to repair ""$20 for kit or $40 for him to fix while i wait.
took the $40 to save my husband and i from all the arguments (we don't work well together).  fast and he even showed me how to do myself next time."
1179,we called steve this past weekend to install a ceiling fan after struggling ourselves. he was very prompt to return our call and was in the neighborhood already so came by that afternoon. he was efficient and professional and now we have a properly installed ceiling fan. definitely will call steve and red truck handyman again!
1180,"awesome! had a shower emergency and troy was at my house 30min later. very polite and professional. this is a small family run business that charges based on repair and not by the hour. no extra expenses or hidden fees. made my stressful morning a little easier. thor industries also repair acs, so i will most definitely save their number should i ever need another fix."
1181,"what a relief... i finally found a handyman that can do everything and do it right! amazing work! i will be using steve from now on for all my jobs, small and large. infact, i am planning on some bigger projects already, now that i have someone i know will do an awesome job. i just met him and i trust him; you can tell right off the bat that he knows what he is doing!

kind, competent, and hardworking. i feel like we ""he"" accomplished so much in one day. #feeling productive 

i am very impressed with steve and happy to have found him through yelp. :-)"
1182,"i have called ronnie a few times over the years and each time he answers my questions, is very honest and very thorough in looking things over. i only wish he would get into the septic repair business as i'd use him in a heartbeat."
1183,did a great fast and efficient front fender repair. great value and quality work. steve the owner got it scheduled and gave various options very happy with the results.
1184,"i can't say enough about this great salon! i've been coming here for a few months now and wish i had found it years ago. ashton is an amazing colorist and dion for cut and style is the bomb! so professional and they both really listen and provide great suggestions. plus, the renovation of the gainey village location is gorgeous!"
1185,"i read about this business on yelp and a friend confirmed it, this place is a ""find"" if there ever was one.  i had several items which needed repair.  

the work was done well, with a quick turn-around time.  i was not in the market for new jewelry but they have a good size collection of beautiful pieces.  add to that, the gracious personality of the owner, rudy and i think you'll be raving as well.   

they now have a new loyal customer, me!"
1186,"the team there really takes the time to fix things right the first time. 
this is not ""quick"" repair place, give them the time they need to repair it right the first time... so many impatient people reviews here"
1187,"excellent place to eat, as we visit often.  i stopped by there tonight to find out they were in the middle of a renovation.... they will be re-opening on february 11th."
1188,"we love the wings here! the recent renovations have been very nice, and we look forward to when the outside patio will be done. for now though the inside dining room is quite loud. maybe adding some soft fabric panels to the wall would absorb some sound. 

as soon as the outside renovations are complete i will update my review. for now it's just four stars because of how loud the inside of the restaurant is. keep up the good work guys it's looking good."
1189,our family had a great time stressing out together while saving ourselves from imminent destruction! collect clues and solve multiple puzzles to make it out in under 60 minutes. you'll need to work together to make it happen. the room was in good repair but was a tight for the six of us. the room we chose was for 2-6 players. the staff were friendly and the facilities were clean. this is a fun way to bond with family and friends!
1190,"after a few weeks of being undecided on my tile for my master and guest bath renovation, i walked in and wanda was eager to assist me. after just telling her what i liked and didn't she directed me to exactly what i didn't know i always wanted! it was perfect. she was polite, professional and friendly and helped me in 40 minutes more than anyone else could in the last 3 weeks. she understood my vision and i left with samples so i could coordinate the rest of my project.thank you wanda for being so creative and helpful and wonderful!!!"
1191,"i love benjamin franklin plumbing. they are consistently professional, on time, always let me know what's going on, and never pressure me into costly repairs. i always call this company whenever i need assistance with plumbing, and have never been disappointed. they are a little pricey, but what plumbing company isn't.? it's worth it to know that everything will be done right, everything is guaranteed, all the plumbers are professional and nice and do good clean work. highly recommend."
1192,"red rock is awesome! it's always been my local casino! it has everything a person could need...bars, restaurants, a bowling alley, movie theaters and gambling. 

recently going through some renovations and upgrades, new restaurants going in. it's bound to be better than ever! mercadito's just opened and soon hearthstone to follow, they are sure to last! with a new noodle bar coming in too...just you wait and see!"
1193,"just to let you know, this place is still open despite it being closed on yelp. they were closed for renovations until about a month or two ago."
1194,"i called at the very last minute (same day) for a small job  everyone else quoted very high on. since they were referred to me by a  handyman, they gave me a great discount, came within hours, and did a bang-up job. quickly too.

i will use them in the future for anything resembling a move!!

professional and knew their stuff.
thanks guys!"
1195,"i highly recommend flo-pro plumbing!  they completed my repairs in a fast professional manner, and explained to me exactly what the issues were and how they resolved them. i will certainly be using them in the future!"
1196,"don't be fooled by the exterior. these guys are fast, friendly, and honest. it has become my go-to for state inspection and repairs."
1197,i just had my transmission and transfer case done here. the manager is very knowledgeable and work was done very professionaly and i was always kept in the loop about repairs and cost. they also offer free towing if you get the work done with them.
1198,"he is the real deal. i always take my clothes, suits and or any leather repairs also too him. i trust nobody else with my clothing."
1199,"i am going to do this review in sections. 
i called jim and he came to the house next day. he is always nice and pleasant to be with.
we signed the paper and he said i was next and he will start next week. next week came and went with no call. took 2weeks before i got the call. i won't take a star cuz i used to be a tile contractor and sometimes jobs take longer.
the crew came today and we talked about how i would like to live while the damage repair goes on.  no arguing, just work. they made a great plastic wall so i have my side and they have theirs.  so far, 5 stars.

day 3 and i can't find anything wrong with these guys.. polite workaholics.. still 5 stars."
1200,"i can't say enough about how amazing my first interaction with innovative plumbing has been.  i requested a quote and within 30 minutes received a response from tiffany.  i received a call the next day from jose who came to my home to diagnose the problem. i was prepared for a large problem and big repair, and jose found the problem quickly, turned the screw and fixed it in minutes!  i had been given information from another plumbing company years ago that was apparently erroneous, and due to that i had a ""banging pipe"" noise problem that i thought would cost me hundreds of dollars.  
jose didn't charge me for the consultation, however, as i remodel and work through other plumbing issues i will absolutely call innovative plumbing pros!  thank you for making my day."
1201,again the guys at pepboys did a great job. had the van repaired in just a few hours. thanks matt and jared.
1202,"this is the best sprint corporate/repair by far.  hesitate to say how great they are brcause do not want them to be busier
so knowledgeable and respectful
will drove 20 miles just to speak with justin"
1203,"technician explained the repairs and was friendly, professional and prompt. rate was reasonable and i would definitely recommend."
1204,"we've used red truck handyman twice now, both time he was quick to respond and completed the job in a timely manner.  found out today that steve has a network of people like ac & plumbing repair people if he can't do it. would definitely call him again if needed.  happy to have a small leak in the water dispenser tube instead of needing a new refrigerator."
1205,"i called blue fox when my aged dryer seemed to be on its last leg. kristian came out, diagnosed a simple fix, and a couple hours later the dryer was humming along, like new. i was excited to know i didn't need a new dryer! it's been a couple months now, and it's still working like new. blue fox were quick, responsive, and spot on with their diagnosis and repair."
1206,"we were in desperate need of someone to come and fix our ceiling (drywall, texture, and paint) after having it cut wide open to repair a leak.  after speaking with several contractors, ryan with advantage home improvement provided the most reasonable quote and was able to come out that day to do the job.

ryan worked hard to finish the multi-step process quickly and efficiently.  he arrived on time and always made sure everything was up to our high standards as he finished.

we are extremely happy with how the ceiling turned out and will recommend ryan to our family and friends.  he did a great job."
1207,"we will be putting our house on the market this month. i wanted to proactively do an inspection so that we wouldn't be ""surprised"" by any hidden potential repairs. selling a home can be stressful and we wanted to be ready! the win team was great. they are professional and thorough. i highly recommend them. thank you for a job well done."
1208,"i've been going to these guys for years, but i have to stay with what i've been going through lately in this vegas heat, matt stanley rocks!!!  he's been kind, courteous, efficient and honest in diagnosing my a/c situation.  mike, greg, jimmy, nathan... they're all efficient and courteous and well.  i'm a single mom and don't need to be patronized because i'm a woman.  i do a lot of repairs myself but when i'm just not up to it, i turn to matt and he takes the problem out of my hands and i no longer worry.  i highly recommend these guys and matt's the man!!!  thanks guys!!!"
1209,great place !  rudy was a great help. he looked up the parts and materials i needed.   i was able to purchase all the parts and tools to effect my repair. . i saved time and money. he showed genuine knowledge and concern.
1210,"i love going to this gym. it's always clean, the janitorial staff is amazing. everyone who works here is great too! the renovations took far too long to have done, but so far things are looking good. hope they continue them because there is still a lot of equipment that needs updating."
1211,"i stopped by pv rugs to inquire about rugs and also needed to find a stand for an oriental fishbowl.   when asking for directions, johnny said ""oh i can fix that!""  well, for very little , he repaired and relacquered it.  i couldn't believe it.  he and ramtin, co-founder, are a delight to with.  i would really recommend them when you are looking for a beautiful rug!"
1212,"it is very difficult finding an honest repair man but, with control temp you will not go wrong. 

i looked around and came upon this suggestion for a company. i was lucky enough to meet up with steve for a second opinion. the first one was a replacement ac unit. as you may know a whole unit is very expensive! 

steve advised me that someone else may suggest a new unit just to make money. that's when i came clean to him and told him he was my second opinion. we laughed and he was able to schedule another visit the next day. 

i am sitting in cool clean air with the holes in my ducts repaired just because he saw them and didn't want the repaired unit to just blow air into my attic. i am thankful for finding control temp and steve the owner. you will be lucky to have them assist you also."
1213,this place resent lay changes their name from team bistro to levito. when we saw the renovation we thought they were closing. my family and i were really mad. there pastas are really great. in our family we have my perspective from a 12 year old my brothers who's a teen and our parents. just don't get the cesar salade they really jump you on the cheese
1214,"go see ernie! initially thought i needed a $50+ part that would need to be special ordered to repair my bathroom faucet. ernie sat with me for quite a while trying to troubleshoot my issue. long story short, spent $5 on an in stock part and help me pre assemble it. went to 4 different places all across town today before i found these guys that were right down the street....ernie killed it...i have one place for my plumbing needs now"
1215,"contacted the company (via yelp) and got a response within minutes.  called and received an appointment (non emergency issue) within 48 hours.  darrell showed up ahead of time (after calling ahead) and diagnosed and repaired my issue within an hour.  i am very impressed with this company and now have no reason to research plumbers again.  hopefully, darrell will be the technician to show since he was very professional and personable."
1216,"i'm so glad i chose best all around roofing for my roof repair! ron, the owner was so thorough in explaining what was needed, the cost, and the process. every time i called the company i was greeted with professionalism and friendliness. my roof estimate was exactly what was charged. i'd do business with this company over and over."
1217,"i have used thor industries for all renovations and repairs for 8 years, both professionally and for my own home.  troy is professional, knowledgeable, experienced and honest.  i highly recommend him!"
1218,i was referred here by my neighbour because i had a hole in my exhaust pipe.  it turned out i needed a flex pipe re-attached.  they were able to get the part and repair it the same day for me.  i am not sure what the going rate was but i think it was fair.  they were pleasant and helpful.
1219,gray place to get smog checks for $7.77 ! hardly any wait time always. i haven't had any repairs done here but in the near future it might be a possibility.
1220,updated review! we love the wings here! the recent renovations are beautiful! changed from a 4 to a 5 because the sound inside is so much better! looking forward to my next visit.
1221,"i have a flat garage roof, which has been troublesome for years. in 2010, i had trades unlimited repair it. they tore out the old roof, down to the plywood, and rebuilt it. then they foamed it. that was three years ago, and i've had no trouble with that roof since. 

flat roofs are really a problem, in my experience. trades unlimited did a great job for me. i recommend them."
1222,best sandwiches hands down... review by fresh start credit repair www.startyourcreditfresh.com
1223,"its been a while since i was here last but things have changed, lots of renovation and the progress is good.  i think this is going to be one of the best malls in the country when they are done"
1224,"we had our tile roof redone. the job went smoothly. the crew arrived on time, repaired minimal damage, repapered and reset the tiles. each day the roof and surrounding areas were left clean of debris.
there was a wind storm that shifted one tile. almeida sent a man out to fix it. the roof has been completed now for two years. we have not had any problems since.
a big thank you to almeida roofing!!!
highly recommend this company.
don and pat ahwatukee"
1225,i used eli for the first time. my upstairs arcadia doors were not sealed correctly and in the last huge storm i had rain coming through my family room ceiling. they did a consult and estimate which i found very fair. they completed the job very quickly. they did not leave any mess whatsoever. they were very friendly. they were able to repair my ceiling as well as fix the problem with my doors. my bill ended up being cheaper than the estimate!! i will definitely use them again!
1226,"i don't often feel compelled to write reviews and it took me several weeks to take the time to write this one. i was vacationing in missouri when my daughter called me from my home in north las vegas to say that the a/c wasn't working! it was early july and very hot. i had her call goettle and they were able to schedule an appointment for the next day, sunday, after my flight arrived so i could be there. the technician, corey, arrived on time as scheduled. corey was courteous and professional. he inspected my system and ran a few tests. corey then climbed into the attic to check the relays on the furnace panel. it had to be 110 in the attic but thankfully corey was determined to be thorough. once corey finished his inspection and testing he offered me several different options for repair. corey thoroughly explained each option with the pricing and was very patient as i asked many questions. when i finally decided on a course of action corey set out to complete the repairs. he was very knowledgable and obviously good at his work. corey had to work in the direct afternoon sun in order to get my a/c operating again. i can't  thank corey enough for his patience and experience. my a/c has never worked better. while i hope i never need major a/c repairs again, if i do, i  certainly will not hesitate to call goettle and request corey! corey did an exceptional job!"
1227,"had them do several small handyman projects which were completed very quickly, were very well done at a very reasonable price"
1228,"last week my parents a/c broke and their house reached 90 degrees. the first repair man through their warranty company didn't know what was wrong with the system and had no clue why freon was leaking, so i took a chance and called elite. 

from the start the receptionist was really friendly and put my parents at ease. their employee j.r. couldn't have been mofriendlier and prompt. he explained everything to my parents in detail and answered their many questions. my parents ended up purchasing a new a/c  and j.r. made sure it was installed that day.  my parents whole experience with dealing with elite was pleasant and stress free."
1229,great job both steve and justin replaced faucet in kitchen and repaired front door lock without having to buy new set. timely efficient and reasonable expense. what more could i want ?  i recommend them both
1230,"i see the dissatisfied comments and complaints and wonder, ""who are these people talking to and about?""  i've had the extreme satisfaction of working with oneguard for almost 15 months and have been very satisfied and even impressed!!  most recently i called concerning water coming through the ceiling into our rental property in peoria, az and was blessed to have liz chavez take my early morning call.  liz was impressive in her knowledge, understanding, and sense of urgency in helping us get a professional contractor on site and in the attic to figure out what the problem was and to make appropriate repairs.  something that i could not do, 1,000 miles away.  thank you liz and thank you oneguard home warranties!!  steve m."
1231,"i hired ryan for a few repair around me house. front door, shower and kitchen faucets needed repair/replacement. i called him on monday to set up an appointment, and on tuesday around noon he was there to do the job. very professional, very personable, and he did a great quality work.

1237,"jack and his guys are a great option to the big roofing companies. i know everyone's experiences vary from situation to situation. ours was super. jack had a busy schedule due to some recent storm damage across the area. he made an extra effort to come out and do an inspection and get me a quote. his guys were clean and neat and the roof was repaired. don't just take my word for it, if you have a roof problem try him yourself and see."

1242,"stopped by for an estimate, couldn't fix the problem because the floor had been repaired where the damage had occurred."
1243,"this guy has great communication, through the month before we started the renovation.  he contacted us throughout and was gracious even though we decided to go with tile.  we would use him in the future!"
1244,"i thought he was great!  he came to our house to repair a wall, and had it repainted. it was a difficult job, because it was on a staircase. but he did a wonderful job."
1245,"they should add the word honest to the company name. honest and affordable garage door repair would probably not fit on their sign but it is a better description. i called and described my issue and was offered 3 solution options. i chose the most cost efficient and was given an initial estimate for repairs. when, robert, the technician arrived, he looked at the issue and determined that the repair could be made even more efficiently. if you can request a specific technician robert would be my guy. he was extremely friendly and personable, honest, and efficient. my door no longer sags and works perfectly. thank you very much robert, and thank you affordable."
1246,"joel arrived on time and worked to complete tasks designated for the home inspection sale of our home.  he was here about three hours, finishing all the repairs with efficiency and a pleasant attitude.  also, the final bill was very affordable!  thanks, joel and rotunda electric!"
1247,our son took my husbands 50th anniversary edition mustang gt out without permission and scuffed up 2 of his rims. ryan from fresh wheels came out and repaired them beautifully saving my son's future.  the guys were friendly and professional and the work was done quickly. we are very impressed.  the process was easy from scheduling to finish. i would highly recommend fresh wheels and will be saving their number for future reference (although our keys are now safely locked away).
1248,had to have hot water heater replaced today. mike arrived and worked non stop for 4 hours. job cost detailed and explained. i am very comfortable using this company for my plumbing repairs.
1249,"my husband and i recently purchased a fixer-upper.  we were on a tight budget to do the renovation, so when i realized we were needing electrical work, all i could think about was how that was going to hammer our budget.  froggy  electric came to the rescue!  they were quick to respond for an estimate and they gave a fair quote. the job was done in a timely fashion and in a totally professional manner.  i recommend froggy electric with the utmost confidence.  it's a great feeling to know they are there for any further electrical needs or changes that arise for us in the future.  with froggy, you get the best!

rita standerfer"
1250,"they recently did a complete renovation of the cafe and it looks so much better now.  much brighter, more outlets, more modern looking, and even has a custom-designed 'heartland' painting on the wall that's really interesting.  great coffee, great treats.  the staff are (usually) friendly, though some of the staff i find very cold like they don't want to be there.  other than that, great location and this will definitely be one of my main coffee spots."
1251,"art was our technician and he did an amazing job!! my husband dealt with him the whole time, but from what my husband told me, he was fantastic! he really was considerate of everything and worked with us to figure out what we needed to repair our water irrigation system. we also found out our water heater was past its lifetime and helped us with that obstacle as well. we appreciate all the knowledge and effort he put into the job. thanks again!"

1258,waking up to a puddle in your yard and side walk is never a good feeling. called on a sunday to get some information and the lady who answered waa polite and empathic to my situation i was surprised they had appointments on the same day. the repair men  came explained what they  were going to do and gave a rough estimate which according to online was less than we found.  they went got the part and said they would come the following day to fill the hole. they were professional and kept their word and filled the hole they even swept the side walk they are my new plumbers
1259,"we had a problem with our outdoor landscape lighting.  based on their yelp reviews i gave them a call on a saturday.  they scheduled an appt with us for the following friday.  they were on time, successfully troubleshot and repaired the problem, and charged us a reasonable amount.  a hassle-free experience.  wouldn't hesitate to call again."

1262,"that nostalgic feeling always comes about when i go to cinema parc. it's cozy and still has kept its charm after all these years. they mostly showcase international films and host various film festivals. 

on a positive note, they have done some renovations and have new red seats. 

if you haven't been here yet, you must come at least once in your life :-)"
1263,"stayed christmas night in the updated ultra hip king room & i was very impressed with the renovations. 
the bathroom had nothing wrong with it & the room was inviting! 
i have stayed at other caesars entertainment properties and the planet hollywood room is so far the best yet!"
1264,very professional and quick. i called first thing in the morning and was able to get an appointment that day. also they were an hour earlier then originally planned but called to make sure it was okay first. which was awesome when your ac unit is not working in the summer in phoenix the earlier the better. and our technician was great! frank was polite and got the job done fast. he was excellent at explaining to me what the problem was and gave me a few options for repairs. he went above and beyond getting our two units working perfectly and the expensive was less then expected. i also found it very useful that he gave me some tips on monthly maintenance i can be doing to keep my units running more efficiently. being a first time home owner i really appreciated this. i will be using hays for any of my future ac/heater needs.
1265,besides the typical vietnamese talk the salon does really good work. i pick my feet really bad and they always repair it without any pain. also the lady is very nice at going beyond and putting cute designs on my toes. also her waxing eyebrows are amazing!!! ^_^
1266,haven't been here since new owners and renovation. it's awesome!  stopped coming and didn't know it changed.
1267,yesenia from one guard called me to make this right. she got a new contractor to come out to my house within 2 hours! a repair was completed and works and they made adjustments on my account charges. that seems like exactly what you should expect as a customer and i am happy with one guard!!
1268,"i have 1 bathroom and it had a blue tub. someone painted it and it was all peeling off it was half blue and half ugly white. i checked different options but wasn't ready to do a full renovation and didn't want to paint it again cause that peels off eventually. surface integrity made my outdated ugly tub look like a band new white tub. i used to hate it and now i love it.  if you have an old tub like mine, it makes all the difference. i chose this route because it's not paint and it doesn't stink. kfir is great too! it was a pleasure to hang out with him between steps and my dog liked him too lol."
1269,"we hired eli to renovate and repair our rental property.  he was professional, efficient, reliable and gave us reasonable quotes for the work.  he has completed various projects for us over the last two years.  we are lucky to have found such a great handyman."
1270,we contracted with renco for our roof repair to repair a leak.  we received a very fair est.  and decided to hire renco.  the next day they called to schedule a time witch turned out to be a matter of just a few days.  their repair man shawn simonson was on time on the scheduled date and the repairs made promptly.  a family owned company who takes pride in there work and guarantees not only there work but your satisfaction.  great company!
1271,"when our ac went out on sunday night, we started calling ac companies. most of them couldn't get here until tuesday afternoon, a long time to be without ac when the temperature is over 100. goettl said they could be here between 8:00 and 10:00 am monday morning. guess who we picked.  they were here at 9:30. ricky found the issue quickly, explained everything throughly, has a wonderfully pleasant and professional personality. the repairs began immediately. after the repair there was a secondary, unrelated, issue. to me, one of the most difficult issues to find are bare wire shorts. for such a difficult issue, ricky found it quickly and made the necessary repairs. btw, we love the 5 year guarantee on the repairs.

the only sticking point we had is how goettl bills. we would have preferred a parts and labor breakdown rather than just a total ""standard"" cost. the problem wasn't the cost, just a presentation preference."
1272,"based on the positive experience i had having my toyota repaired, i consider this business to be trustworthy and professional and i would highly recommend it."
1273,"my nephew had a fence installed by henry fence last year and was very happy with them. recently our gate was heavily damaged by winds so we called for quotes from a couple companies including henry fence. the gate was repaired (by henry fence) in a very timely manner at a reasonable cost. in fact, we're still waiting for a quote from the other company ; ) 

i would not use anyone else."
1274,great facility. driving range has improved tremendously since gil took over. nice to have a grest coach and a repair facility so close to home.

if you want the best call the red truck handyman!!!"
1276,"trust!!!!!!

this company is built on trust !!!!!

kristian the co owner and who did the repairs was prompt and very respectful. he asked a lot of question to see what my issue were. he then took his time and examined the refrigerator which was not providing water or ice for 6 months. kristian was very clean and his diagnostics were on point which saved me a lot of money.  blue fox could have charged me a lot more then they did but the issue was fixed fast and the work was not only efficient but kristian explained what the issue were and what i can do to prevent this from happening in the future and how i can handle the problem myself. 

i trust this company and i will use and recommend them in he future."
1277,the repairs done were excellent. it did take longer than expected. srs system needed more parts replaced than first diagnosed. overall good job.
1278,i called jason on a saturday morning because my air conditioner went out through the night. the highs today were in the 80s so i was dreading another night sleeping in the house without air. he was able to come over this evening and repaired my unit in under 30 minutes. he was conscientious and punctual. i will definitely call him again should the need arise.
1279,"the lights and microwave in our kitchen were not working, so we called copper king electric since they came highly recommended to us by our neighbor. cory was able to be at our house the day we called and found that we had a loose wire causing the problems. he was able to repair the wire quickly, and we were pleasantly surprised that copper king's rates were very reasonable and less than other electrical companies we have used in the past. we highly recommend copper king electric and will be using them for all of our electrical needs in the future."
1280,"i needed my fence bolted to the brick wall where it had pulled away. i requested several quotes and red truck was very responsive. we set a date and a price. a few days before the date i realized i had a conflicting schedule and reached out to see if we could reschedule. no problem- he'll come out do the repairs and invoice me. before i got home, i had several photos of the repairs. when i saw the work in person i saw he did a great job! i would use red truck again."

1284,"we had a handyman we used within our family who all of a sudden dropped off the face of the earth and wouldn't return our calls after failing to not show up for a scheduled appointment.  eli was referred to us by a family friend of ours. eli showed up on time, he and his partner were efficient in completing my honey-do list. eli was great to work with and rates seemed reasonable. so far so good... keeping fingers crossed we found our one and only.."

1286,"due to the recent hurricane rains in az, our kitchen ceiling began to leak. we felt it was probably from the small overhanging roof above, but we needed someone to come out and assess the situation. when jim arrived, i was immediately impressed by his friendly demeanor and professionalism. he did a thorough investigation into the potential issues and recommended that we go with a handyman, as he believed our roof was in overall good condition and the problem could be dealt with rather inexpensively. he easily could've upsold us and taken the job as he had already come all the way out, but he didn't. if we ever do need roof repair, we will absolutely go with jim!"
1287,i needed to get wheel rash repaired on my audi and porsche (for the second time).  i used fresh wheels previously and naturally i called them when i needed work again.  ryan does a fantastic job to make the wheels look like new.  you cannot tell that they have ever been repaired because he does flawless work.  i highly recommend this company.  you will not be disappointed.
1288,fast. charming and professional. if i lived here i'd make this my go to place. it took less than 10minuted and the repair was done in front of me as i waited.

i won't go to anyone else to touch my mower from here on out as jj is as good as it gets."
1293,"found advance gas fireplace repair through on line search and took a chance after reading other reviews.  charlie showed up on time when scheduled and  quickly fixed our minor problem without needing additional parts. he was helpful and friendly and gave us good maintenance tips to keep the fireplace operating well.  i am writing this review without being asked.   i'm not related to him, nor am i a personal friend.  i will for sure use him again for any fireplace repair needs."
1294,"had a great experience with rich! we hired him to replace some hoses and valves on our water heater and also install a temperature relief valve and line. he also installed an ro system for us under our kitchen sink. he was very easy to work with, on time for the estimate and repairs, flexible with our schedule and fair on his pricing. we plan to use him again in the future for our plumbing needs."
1295,"we had a jenn aire electric wall oven go out.  this is easily the fifth or sixth time that one guard has come to the house over the last couple of years to repair or replace something.  in this instance, one guard tried to locate the parts for the oven, but was unable to due to age of the oven.  tina at one guard worked with me to find just the right replacement that would match the other jenn air products in my kitchen.  she spent some time on this to make sure we got it right.  well done tina & one guard."
1296,new renovations are great! underground tunnel is cool. check in and security checks are pretty quick. not as dynamic as yyz but super convenient.
1297,"i recently started what i thought was a quick water hose valve replacement, i quickly started having issues. i called a few 24 hr plumbers and all told me not having running water isn't an emergency and wouldn't come out. matt answered when i called and was at my house in 20 minutes. he even gave me a few pointers when doing a repair like this in the future. thanks matt"
1298,"i've been using king of condos for the past 4 years.  not only did they help me find exactly what i was looking for condo-wise, they also are great property managers.  i've have a few major/minor repairs needed to be fixed and they always have someone out right away to fix them.  recently this weekend my ac went out and i called them first thing monday morning and they had someone out within hours of my call!  thank you!!!"
1299,had to follow up with this place.  my house had a leak in the roof we found out today because of the rain.  homelovers got a call from the tenant already and they have arranged for the repair.  i love it!  no more calls from the tenant about problems.  they're doing all the work that would normally take me away from me doing mine!  these people are a must have for anyone with rentals.    got homelovers?  i do !  maybe i'll sell them that slogan.  lol
1300,"we hired eli the handyman when we opened our new office in mesa.  they sent to very qualified, very polite and knowledgeable technicians!  we had them assemble tables, assemble and hang cabinets, mount some 40"" televisions and then hang some pictures and miscellaneous items on the walls for us.  after giving instruction they went to work, completed the task and asked what was next!  it was a pleasure doing business with them and i would highly recommend them!"
1301,"i just moved into my new home, the fireplace didn't work and i don't know much about them.

i contacted charlie, based on other's reviews. he came out when promised, was on time and very kind.

after looking at my fireplace, he told me that it should be in fine working order, but it wasn't working because it didn't have the burner. the gas line had been capped and all that was in there were the logs.

when he said that, it was an 'aha moment'...i felt quite dumb asking him out for nothing. he was honest with me and said that he doesn't typically 'install', when there's nothing wrong with a fireplace. he said that it is very simple to do, and i could do it myself.

he spent the next 15 minutes walking me through the process and informing me about my fireplace and what size burner to get and where i could get it. he shared important safety information with me as well.

i could tell that he probably wasn't going to charge me for his visit, so i offered $20 and a solid review of my experience on yelp.

charlie was clearly the kind of businessman that wouldn't take advantage of ignorant people. this is the most important quality in any business. he certainly could have milked me for money, bought what i needed and charged me to install it. instead he taught me how to do it myself and gave me safety tips and tips on how to save money as well.

i will certainly refer to him anyone i can, and call on him whenever my fireplace truly needs repair."
1302,"i had been smelling a ""hot"" smell from my ac for a few days.  on monday it was much stronger so i called and made an appointment.  i was quoted $49 but told that if repairs were needed there wouldn't be that charge.  i had an appointment for them to arrive between 4-6pm and told i'd get a call about 40 minutes before.  i got a call exactly 40 minutes before and they arrived at 4:06pm.  the two that came were very professionally.  she was in training so i got to overhear the technical explanations and never felt like they were trying to up sale me.  on the contrary.  there was a short in my thermostat.  the fixed it and climbed into the sauna of an attic to check out everything else.  the even sent me pictures of the different parts for reference.  they spent an hour there and only charged $49!  they went above and beyond!  thanks goettl!"
1303,"open sesame doors are the best! i always research and yelp businesses before i make any decisions. i even asked recommendations from our community blogs and figure out which one's best. sent ronen, the owner a message on yelp and he responded within minutes. 20 minutes later, he sent mike to take a look at the problem on my garage and right away figured out the problem. mind you, i have youtube'd every problem i might be having just to see if ""my no-handyman hubby"" could fix this lol..., i said, no way. we need professionals to do this. ronen came out himself to fix our problem since my hubby was having second thoughts and wanting more quotes from other company (which then i told him, i felt like i already chose the right one!) sure enough, less than an hour later, problem solved! ronen was very friendly, professional and very knowledgeable. and the best part is they're open 24/7! i will definitely recommend them to my friends and family!"
1304,"i had a mr. handyman out for a very small drywall repair. from estimate to completion, the process was very efficient and professional. paid less than what the estimate was for. i'm so glad we finally found a reliable go-to for home repairs and installations :-)"

we have had so many places jerk us around and feed us bs but not these guys. they will check an issue and give an honest answer without adding unnecessary repairs or additions to it.

these are the guys we go to when anything goes wrong since having our serpentine belt replaced by them. joe does good by his customers and those who walk in."
1307,"rick d. was very professional, right on time and completed repair quickly.  had the necessary replacement part on his truck so a second trip was not necessary and kept cost affordable.  i would defanetly recommend him.

1313,yes they were very helpful they install the window motor for me for years ago plus and it malfunctions so they went ahead and repaired it and only charge me for the labor which was still $135 but better than 210 so at least they stand by their work for one year and lifetime warranty on the parts so all in all i'd say two thumbs up for job guys
1314,goettl was the 3rd plumber i called to get a leak repaired in my bathtub. the plumber was very professional and thorough. i didn't selector use them because the quote was higher than the others but i would definitely consider them in the future

they weren't happy until we were happy. a good experience. i'll use them again."

1349,"so happy i chose this company from prior yelp reviews. roger was the technician that came to my house and repaired my refrigerator icemaker. 

the hopper for the icemaker was frozen solid into the door and i could not get it removed from the door. roger worked to get the ice hopper out of the door and was successful. he discovered ice frozen in the blades of the icemaker, plus in the channel that distributes the ice. the ice in the channel was holding the flapper open and only made the ice melt more and make the hopper stick worse.  within a half hour or less roger had frozen ice removed. 

i was unable to tell until today if it was working or not because the hopper was empty and i had a wait for ice  to be made. i've used it twice this afternoon and so far it seems to be working really well. 

thank you roger for a job well done!"
1350,"i called this company because i had a leaking kitchen faucet that i tried to repair myself. after 8 hours of frustration went on yelp and saw this company with great reviews. now i'm pretty skeptical about plumbers because i had a bad experience and felt ripped off. but justin changed my mind about plumbers, first he came early, was courteous and understood my predicament. after trying to get it fixed he came to the conclusion that i needed a new faucet set because mine was worn out. so he packed up didn't charge me to even come out and look at it, blew my freaking mind! thanks second opinion plumbing."

aside: it has been a 5yr renovation a bit at a time. better to use profits than take a loan out and do it all at once i presume.  guess who would pick up that burden of loan interest costs if this all occurred at once?  that's right...the members.  to that point, over 6 years, the normal member rates have not increased at all.  still around $50-45/month."
1362,had a great experience! repairman showed up on time and did the repair work and was very honest and fair! i highly recommend and will use this company in the future!

1368,hired eli the handyman to install a doggie door in my house. i just move to az and read reviews of handymen and decided on them. vladimir came out and was very professional. did an outstanding job.  i even asked him to help me with a security light and helped me fix the issue with no problem. i asked him for some quotes on other jobs and he did it in the spot. i will definitely be calling them again for work to my new home. definitely reccommend!!
1369,"a repair technician/company that actually repairs the equipment you have:  i had the best experience with jf air and heat.  my response time was excellent and the job was completed within 24 hours.  jason was very knowledgeable about my air conditioner and knew exactly what was needed to repair it.  my old 15 year old unit had lost all of it's refrigerant through the electrical interface in the compressor, he was proactive in suggesting to upgrade it to the modern environmentally friendly coolant.  he scheduled the appointment, called while en-route and arrived within 30 minutes that he had stated.  he replaced my compressor and capacitor in about 2 hours.  the charges were exactly in my sweet spot and resulted as stated for repair, parts and taxes."

absolutely would recommend and hope to get them started on my next project very soon!!!"
1371,i hate construction and christopher has made me feel so comfortable with how meticulous he is and i don't worry at all because he's a perfectionist.   only a week in to my bathroom renovation and over the moon happy with how hard he works and the results.  he's better than the best!  you won't go wrong with his work.  even with my tight schedule he's made this a breeze.

1391,"we used barbera roofing in april, 2015.  we chose them because a local animal shelter had used them and we found out that barbera donates part of their profits from roof jobs to the animal shelter.  they did a fine job for us and in one day completed the house roof and the garage roof.  we did not have any issues at all with them.  my neighbor ended up calling them to do some shingle repairs for his house."

1396,"called copperstone with a non-emergency repair on our 1959 house. my sink wasn't draining i wasn't sure why there were two p-traps instead of one. the good news i stumped clint and the better news is he removed the excess pipes and installed one p-trap like it should be. oh, and when he removed the current setup the odor was so bad it made my eyes water. i t seems that two p-traps defeat the purpose of the system.he was kind enough to walk the house with me and answer my questions about our plumbing.thanks !"
1397,great work at a fair value. i have used them for years for everything from simple repairs all the way to custom exhausts.
1398,"i recommended pruitts plumbing to my sister for her plumbing leak.  they arrived the same day, diagnosed the issue and repaired the leak in a timely manner.  they were professional and efficient."
1399,i had some serious drywall damage where some handyman did a terrible job on the texture. i called kb up and the next day he was here fixing it with minimal mess. he taped off and put plastic everywhere to prevent any dust and did an amazing job !!!
1400,"i agree with tina's review below. i had an excellent experience with a refrigerator repair. they kept me informed regarding that the parts needed for the repair were ordered, when the parts arrived and set up an appointment at the same time. the technician called me the day of the repair to confirm the appointment and he arrived on time. i'm not minimizing the experience that other people had. it seems that the problems had previously with some of their employees has been rectified. i would gladly use them again."
1401,"sent by my home warranty company and have nothing but praise. dealing with contractors from home warranty companies for over ten years, they were great compared to a lot of others. attempted to actually take the pump apart on the washer and repair it immediately but had to order a new one. they promptly got a replacement and any delays on final repair were my fault. very accommodating on time frames since i'm not a morning person, very polite and very professional."
1402,mark was very professional and polite. he was at my home within 3 hours of my call and it wasn't an emergency.  because i wasn't home he called me with each step of the repairs.  the repair was completed quickly and efficiently.  i will be using mvp for all my plumbing needs for now on.
1403,"i called in earlier this afternoon for a quote to repair some loose pilaster caps on my fence. bob the owner took my call and said that he could come out in a few hours to take a look. not only did he do that, he completed the repair work today as well in about an hour! super reasonable pricing and very nice work. i'd highly recommend this company for your masonry needs."
1404,"i have been working with brian for almost a decade, first as property manager on my rental in glendale and more recently on the sale of another property in queen creek.  my experience with brian has been at the highest level in terms of his competence, honesty and consideration. as a banker for more than 47 years myself and the owner of more than 18 properties over time, i can honestly say that brian is the best real estate professional i have ever collaborated with! 

brian is a pleasure to work with and his resourcefulness knows no bounds in dealing with real estate issues, ranging from flooding, remodeling to minor repairs, many of which are inevitable and frequent as we all know.  i highly recommend brian vascassenno and propertyaz!"

1406,went in for a quick repair and demitri was super helpful! fixed them within 5 minutes he's awesome
1407,"steve was great! he was prompt, responsive, thorough & pretty much the nicest guy ever. score.

the hubs and i just moved to a new home, and we needed to have our washer and dryer hooked up ... but it wasn't your standard install job. our new home is 20 years old and had a 4-prong outlet in the laundry center. but the cord on our dryer was 3-prong. so steven swapped out the 3-prong dryer cord for a 4-prong. 

steve also hooked up the washer---even though we didn't ask him to. he simply did it on his own. and he didn't charge us for it!!! he didn't charge us for the 4-prong cord either because he happened to have one in his truck. (the cords are about $20 at home depot.)

speaking of $$$: i got 4 other quotes for this job. all the other quotes were between $95 and $150. steve charged me $40!!! his rates are very, very reasonable.

steve's a lovely person, and he was an absolute pleasure to work with. i'll be giving him a buzz the next time i need a handyman!"
1408,"quick update! since i pointed out the bad, i feel it's only fair to acknowledge the good. dawan, the maintenance man, is amazing! he's respectful, he's knowledgeable, and he fixes things correctly the first time. he respects my clean home and always cleans up after himself. after one maintenance man telling me my oven and stove were fine and functioning properly, i submitted another request knowing full well it was in disrepair. dawan came out in a timely manner, saw it was broken, and ordered me a new one. anytime i see him on the property, he's always friendly to my children and i and always has a smile on his face. i'm not fond of allowing anyone in my home when i'm not there but i absolutely trust dawan. he's definitely an asset to union hills!"
1409,"my home warranty company sent them out when my oven wasn't working. the technician (tanner) was on time, friendly, and explained the issue i was having so i could understand it (and he didn't try to up-sell me on parts or repairs i didn't need!) i would definitely use this company again!"
1410,"if you have to have something repaired, this is the place to go. they are quick, efficient, do excellent work and do their best to do it in the most cost efficient manner. i highly recommend this place!!"
1411,simple to make an appointment request. they returned a call within an hour and were able to schedule the repairs at a perfect time. technician arrived on time and performed the installation perfectly. he left the bathrooms perfectly clean and in record time by my expectations!!! billing was simple via email after the repair. we would not hesitate to use them again or recommend absolutely.
1412,"bottom line is that dan did a great job.  arrived on time, handled all our issues, was very neat and did an inexpensive repair on something i thought required an expensive replacement, so add honest and above board to the list.  i've used jd before for big and small jobs and they always deliver.  great company."
1413,"got an appointment quickly, frank was friendly, professional and completed the repairs in 30 min.  highly recommended!"
1414,"i had a ""small"" repair job to be done and our previous electrician said it was too small a job for him to bother with. christian gave an accurate quote and amount of time it would take. it only took him 30 seconds to find out what the problem was and it was fixed in 20 minutes.

he was not only on time, but 15 minutes early. it's great to find an electrician that is dependable and does a great job. it was educational for me as well. we will be changing electrician now to 4 daughters electric. i highly recommend you do."
1415,"dan is a blessing! 

i was fortunate to find him on next door and he was able to get me in quickly.  i wanted to install elfa shelves and he was able to not just get this done, but with perfection! here's three reasons why handyman dan is my goto: 

1. quality work
2. honest and fair pricing
2. communication (even emails receipts) 

good luck and happy repairs to all!"
1416,called james and he was able to come out the same day. he was also able to accommodate my tenants schedule and get everything installed and repaired within the same day again. great guy to deal with. much appreciated! will use again.

1418,"my family and i loved our time spent with front porch! we rented a great home from them for over 7 years. we moved in 2 months after getting married with a dog, 3 adults, and 3 children! the process couldn't have been smoother. walk thru at beginning and end are straight forward and easy, the family we rented from were amazing and let us paint to feel like it was ""our home"". the a/c went out and was repaired by a preferred vendor within 24hrs. family owned meant they remembered our names whenever we called in! i wouldn't hesitate to use them again (hopefully soon for a purchase) - thank you bob & debbie!"

1422,"we had a leak in our courtyard faucet. on the recommendation of a friend we called jack dish plumbing. we set up a date & time window, joey arrived exactly on time. he assessed the situation but needed a part. the job was pushed to the next day, since it was not an emergency situation. trey came exactly on time the next day, he worked steadily until the faucet was repaired. trey was professional, knowledgeable & timely in getting the job done!"
1423,"i called early afternoon and the tech (jeff) was at my door within two hours.  i explained the problem and he went up on the roof to evaluate.  the evaluation and repair were completed within an hour and a half.  jeff was courteous and professional, explained everything in detail, and made recommendations for proper maintenance of heat pumps.

note: i had another company look at this unit and was quoted around $1,250 to get it in operable condition.  goettl completed the repair for around 25% of the previous quote."
1424,"i was referred to jake by a neighbor to repair a drip system leak.  he returned my call promptly, was out at the site the next day and was very reasonable.  on top of that, he discovered and fixed additional issues and did a great job overall.  i would highly recommend him!"

1426,"i highly recommend dan! he is honest, on time and has great communication skills.  he is also educated in many different areas of home improvement and offers great pricing.  i am so grateful that i stumbled upon him.  he took a nightmare shower issue i had from a prior installer and made it so much better!  he also recently fixed electrical issues from prior people and made my home a safer place.  dan will definitely be doing tons of work around my house!  thank you a handyman dan!"
1427,"been meaning to leave a review and never have gotten around to it. i had a doggy door that was removed but left a hole in the stucco that needed to be fixed. contacted max and got a response in less than 20 minutes. came out quickly and fixed the stucco. can't even tell that it was fixed..the texture matches perfectly with the rest of the house. 

not only does he do a great job but hes a great guy in general. even had a great conversation while he was doing the repair. overall would definitely recommend to others. can't go wrong if you need any stucco work done."
1428,"i was going to replace my old ceiling fan myself in our diy room remodel, but i'm no electrician and didn't want the fan to come crashing down in a week lol... eli the handyman to the rescue! i had a quote via email in hours and they came out later that week. the guys showed up on time, took less than an hour, and cleaned up afterward. they even offered to dispose of my old fan! i'll be calling them again for sure."
1429,goettl was the 3rd plumber i called to get a leak repaired in my bathtub. the plumber was very professional and thorough. i didn't select to use them because the quote was higher than the others but i would definitely consider them in th

1432,"a friend of mine recommended i make the drive to drop off my rudsak coat for repairs here instead of taking it to the cleaners near my house and i'm so glad i did! i had a pretty large rip in the underarm of my coat and they did the repair onsite in less than 2 hours, for only $20. they did such a good job that i can't even pinpoint where the repairs were made, it's perfect. thank you thank you!!"

1436,these guys are good guys. jeff and dan will respond quickly. they give all types of options and work with you even if you are picky. they have a good crew that comes in and works hard. they didn't just do my landscaping but they can also do general contracting (handyman) work which is a big plus. no need to source multiple people. i would definitely use them again for future jobs.
1437,"looking for a reliable plumber for your plumbing issues? look no further. just call american plumbing and you will be glad that you do.
i have used american plumbing to fix a leak at the main water supply line, and i continue to use this company for any future plumbing needs because of the following reasons:
1. excellent communications and quote system. you can request a free quote for your job/issue in 10 minutes just by using the online 'request a quote' on yelp, a well designed and so user-friendly that i had not seen before.
if you prefer to call, then rich t., the owner of american plumbing, will get you a straightforward and detailed quote on what needs to be done/replaced for the job/issue. 
the quoted price is the price you pay at completion of job. no more, no less!

2. fair and reasonable price. for my plumbing issue, i contacted american plumbing and 2 other companies for a quote, and the price i got from american plumbing is at least 20% cheaper.

3. quality of work performed. rich was the technician performing the repair work for me. as promised, he called me 30 minutes prior to his arrival. a skilled professional with 19+ year plumbing experience,rich completed the repair job quickly, cleanly and within the time frame promised. after everything tested and checked out well, i got an invoice with the written 2-year warranty for all the work performed. 
rich even gave me some advice on how to protect the new black flow preventer he installed for me against cold weather.

this is a long-overdue review, but i just wanted to say thanks to rich and american plumbing.

rich, you are best of the best! i will absolutely call you for my future plumbing needs."

1440,they responded to me very quickly on yelp super positive. estimate and repair went well i gave a 4 cuz we had a slight hiccup he was supposed to come friday between 3 and 6 by 530 it's dark and there's no way he could work in the yard so i called and she said closer to 6 so i said better reschedule so it kinda messed up my friday but he came by 9 the next morning and was done in ten minutes so we could go on with our day. they stuck to estimate which is always good. would probably work with them again. well had to give 5 stars they followed up with me and made everything right ! fantastic company
1441,"i hate construction and christopher has made me feel so comfortable with how meticulous he is and i don't worry at all because he's a perfectionist.   only a week in to my bathroom renovation and over the moon happy with how hard he works and the results.  he's better than the best!  you won't go wrong with his work.  even with my tight schedule he's made this a breeze!
all done within 2.5 weeks, and that's with a major design change from the original plan.
see pics of before and after-mind blowing.  he does the consult, pricing, all the work, and clean up...on time and completely professional."
1442,great guys. good work. always on time. recommend. will use again. they did concrete removal and concrete pour. they also did some roof repair on my two story.
1443,"i used redline in dec 2016 to repair a broken window in my peoria az winter home, i was so impressed with terry the window tech guy, that i got an estimate from them in january to replace 3 old single pane windows and up grade to double pane, aluminum frame.  it took a little over 3 weeks to get the windows manufactured because i only wanted aluminum and not vinyl, they finished up last week and installed all 3 windows.  james the installer did an excellent job and i would definitely use redline in the future if needed."

1448,"i hired simple electric to replace 4 outlets that needed to be converted to gfci from a standard outlet. one was outside and three were indoors. the person who arrived, disagreed with the one outlet needing to be replace but because it was required by the inspection for the sale of the house, we had to replace them. he worked quickly, installing all four in less than 30 minutes. it was not a problem to provide our own hardware, so they just charged us for the labor. four stars because the cost was high for the work performed. if i could have done the repairs myself i would have but the inspection required a professional to do it. overall, they were friendly and easy to work with."
1449,"this afternoon i walked to and climbed up to the top of mount royal (i've done it a few times in the past).

the stairs are at the top of peel avenue.  it's not an easy climb up!  there is some repair going on so i had to detour along a path. 

the view of the city are worth the climb!

heading down was a lot easier than going up!"
1450,"i hired five star roofing in pittsburgh for a property of mine in dormont. they were timely, performed the work professionally, and were priced extremely affordable compared to other estimates that i received.

paul was very responsive to my concerns and personally got up on the roof to inspect his crew's work sending me regular pictures and videos to put my mind at ease.

the roof has held up extremely well. it's been a year since the work was performed and the many leaks we were experiencing prior to their arrival haven't leaked since.

i would recommend five star roofing unequivocally for all my roofing needs, and will refer them to my friends and family should they ever need a roof repair or replacement."
1451,"trades unlimited repaired and replaced our roof in 2011 and did a fantastic job.  from start to finish, warren and his team were professional and very pleasant to work with.  we haven't had a single problem with the roof and we have recommended trades unlimited to neighbors and friends."
1452,"my call was answered when placed, and an appointment was set up for the next day. bill was affable and professional and only repaired what was needed(no upsell). excellent experience !"
1453,"adrian did a very good job of finding issues that were overlooked by another company that visited us last year. to be fair the company that we had out last year was hired to come in, re-aim the safety trip-sensors and lube the hinges. which they did a fine job of.
today, we had adrian from gararge doors 4 less out to fix the opener, which decided to just stop working over the weekend. we called them yesterday (a sunday) and we were able to get an appointment for today. adrian analyzed the problem right away (the opener needed a new logic board - the old one was visibly ""burnt""). he also noticed a small crack in the connection point for the opener arm where it attaches to the door. it could cause a big problem down the road if not fixed. 
so, for a lot less than the cost of a new opener, he finished the repairs and got it all done in about 90 mins. oh, he also showed up on time, another ""score"" in my book.
i highly recommend garage doors 4 less if you need repairs on your garage door!"
1454,"these guys are legit, always on time and honest with their work! they can even work with your budget and get the job well done! thanks gg handyman! these guys are highly recommended."
1455,"arrived quickly, repaired garage door placing strut. professional with good price..highly recommend."

1457,"if you need a lamp repaired here in phoenix, this is the place for you. ask for billy - the owner. (avoid the grouchy old lady at the front desk: she's mean as a witch in a fairy tale.) i have been a customer tor 10 years. the best thing they do is transform pots, vases, etc. into exquisite, customized lamps. their selection of shades and finials is off the chart. highly recommended."
1458,"had some ac issues and called my warranty company oneguard.  az trademasters called,  i needed an appointment to work around my work schedule and it was not a problem accommodating me.  two technicians showed up in clean uniforms and groomed. ( first appt. of the day)   they introduced themselves and shook hands. 
they diagnosed the problem quickly. explained it so it made sense.  they did the repair and cleaned up after themselves.   they even allowed me to wash the unit out before they buttoned it up.   to be honest, i read the yelp review before they came out and had my guard up.  techs steve and jaime did good in my book.  i would hire them again."
1459,"terrific experience with a quick hoover vacuum repair in 10 minutes end to end handled by the owner. i can't recommend park ridge enough for their expertise and attention to detail, whether it is a more complex job or an easy belt repair.  great job."
1460,"an honest repairman!  fast, polite, and very reasonable pricing.  i'm recommending them to everyone i know."
1461,"with two days notice, these guys showed up promptly at 8:30 am as scheduled.
they got right to work.  prior to assembling they laid out all the parts and counted the screws to make sure all items were there.
they completed the assembly of an l desk, 2 bookcases, a sofa table, and a file cabinet within 2 hours.
they cleaned up and walked all the packaging outside for the trash.
highly recommend and useful to this single gal void of a personal handyman, for now."
1462,"i have gone to park ridge vacuum for over 20 years. the owner is always honest and reasonable regarding repair costs, and whether it's worth the money to repair my vacuum. today  i stopped in because i was contemplating the purchase of a new vacuum. he asked me about my current one and what it was or wasn't doing, and he ended up suggesting that i try a $3.00 repair to it before i buy a new one.  i would definitely recommend park ridge vacuum."
1463,"update: because of jeremy, my ac has been repaired completely free of charge by the company that installed it. it is nice to see that there are companies that still have integritythank you jeremy and amy!

jeremy was sent to my house 1 day after calling to see what was wrong with my ac. he was professional and patient with me and my dog and cats. he took the time to explain the issue and what my options were for the repair. he could have left with doing much less than that, as has been my experience with many other companies. when he noticed my distress he stayed and helped me through it ,along with amy, to figure out a plan. shaffer & sons heating and cooling really did make a difference today. thank you jeremy and amy!!!

22 to none"
1464,"we just used jamie at lv valleywide handyman this week to help fix multiple items in our home. he was on time, professional, friendly and very reasonable. 

i recommend him without hesitation!"

1466,dale is an exceptional handyman!   he just completed installing my kitchen shelves and they're perfect.  he is very knowledgeable and well-skilled.  i would definitely request dale !
1467,"this review is for the real estate department. the all in agent team at stonegate went above and beyond for us.  we were so happy that our friend highly recommend them. they fought hand over fist to get the best possible deal for us on our investment properties. they coached us through our options and helped us make the right decision.  all the inspections were set up for us (they have a great team of resources) and helped get us a repair credit on top of that. now, we have over $10k in equity in just a little over year for our investment properties. 

don't hesitate to call tania and san or even any one of the realtors at stonegate. everyone there is very helpful."
1468,"manager zack campos helped me get the right stone pavers for a difficult patio repair of existing travertine. everyone was helpful, knowledgeable and patient. they were an invaluable resource that allowed us to be successful in matching our stone."
1469,jamison was amazing.  he showed up to our home on time and took the time to understand the items we wanted him to do.  he not only did a fantastic job but he did it in a very timely fashion.  and the best part...he was professional and personable.  would highly recommend him for any handyman job.  we will continue using him for all work.
1470,thoughts and prayers for the staff of hfh for speedy repairs after the fire. what a shame!
1471,second time we've stopped in here for a repair. the first time was done on the spot and she didn't ask for payment - we tipped regardless. this time we dropped two pieces and expected to wait days/weeks - we picked up our fully repaired and polished items later that afternoon.
1472,the clam ligunie is absolutely amazing !! never disappointed! the place looks terrific after the renovation !!!!
1473,"we have used dodge electric several times. the only issue i have had that has been bad (for me, not for them) was that they are always booked out and it's hard to get an appointment quickly. and you have to have them come out, give you a bid, and then schedule again for them to do the work.

their work has always been top-notch, although they do leave the drywall repairs for another person to do, just so you know (i would think that's normal for electricians). but they have had to fix botched electrical jobs that others have done and they fixed them well, or did our jobs right the first time, every time we have used them."
1474,"i have been here several times and can't say enough.  they are so nice and helpful.
one time i was told i could do the repair myself, and he told me how to do it!  saved me $$$$

im sold!"
1475,"if you live in pittsburgh, you may understand how contentious the issue of ""favorite local thai restaurants"" is.

so, i'll begin this review w/ my personal bias: thai cuisine is our go-to thai restaurant in pittsburgh. this is in part due to proximity, but the relationship is on no small part sustained through friendly staff and consistent dining experiences.

thai cuisine is -- as my wife and i like to put it -- a rainy-sunday-evening type place. their curry broths are great, the apps are tasty, but not too filling, and the ambiance -- particularly after their recent renovations -- is warm and inviting.

i'll admit, that if your'e in it purely from a culinary angle, there may be better options, but for the buck, you won't find many that beat thai cuisine."
1476,"they made time to fit me in at the end of the day to repair a leaking irrigation system. they capped the problem line quickly, and the cost was reasonable. i appreciate the flexibility to make a same day call, and i will definitely call again if i have any more jobs in the future."
1477,"super efficient, really nice, and charged way less than other handymen i talked to. i had a bunch of little projects that he helped with which was really nice. worked out great and was timely and efficient."
1478,dan is da man!! i had my chain ripped off my neck by a psychotic patient. snapped off the lobster clasp which costed me over 200 bucks. brought it to dan who fixed it in 2 minutes and 34 seconds!!! i will go nowhere else for my repairs. he truly is the dr of jewelry . thx dan your da man!!!
1479,"as a homeowner, you try to save your budget by tackling simple fixes yourself. however, sometimes the simplest fix can get complex and when that fix involves electricity. i am a firm believer that you should call in a pro to make sure it is done correctly, so your home is safe. 

i have called the team at dodge on two occasions where a home repair made me a bit uncomfortable and each time they came out and rectified the problem properly and at a great rate. i have found their techs to be honest, knowledgeable, friendly, clean, and properly priced. 

i will surely use them again and encourage you to try them out."
1480,"absolutely 100% honest, discovered a very inexpensive repair to what i thought was a very expensive problem. highly recommended."
1481,"bruce tomson is serious about doing the best job possible!  he repaired the cracks, holes and discolored grout of our aged travertine tile floors. the result was excellent!  in addition, he is prompt, keeps to his time schedule and leaves the floors clean and looking amazingly better. he is a pleasure to work with."
1482,my go-to place for repair jobs.   i have had frames welded and ear pieces replaced.   fast and high quality.
1483,highly recommend deni. had a problem with garage door shutting due to panel being cracked. thought i was gonna have to replace door or panel which is in the $600+ range..deni  made a quick repair that cost me under a $100 and he was only here for 20 minutes..good guy too..really down to earth guy..definitely recommend him..
1484,"the renovations are nice, looking forward to seeing what else is to come. decent room for the price. also looking forward to taking advantage of mlife rewards."
1485,"i wanted to have some minor repair work done to a coffee table and end table. i found ken online, he was super quick to respond to my email. i sent pictures, he provided a quote quickly and set up an appointment for the following week. the work was done at my home. took him about 30 minutes and looks as good as brand new without completely stripping, sanding etc. definitely recommend ken if you need this type of work done."
1486,"jaime is a dream, he is great w communicating his arrival time and he was punctual and i know how busy he is but he answered all my questions, he installed a beautiful chandelier in my daughter's room, he was a great handyman and even my dog loves him, she usually bark like crazy but she was so quiet while jaime worked. thanks jaime and looking forward to working with you again!!!"
1487,"we were planning our trip to las vegas when i ran across the description of madame tussauds in frommers...what sold us was the promise that one could ""fondle j.lo's butt""...yes, that's a direct quote. not that we would want to do that, mind you, but another friend in our traveling group would.

madame tussauds didn't disappoint. in a world where production shows confiscate cameras, and an errant shot in a casino can get you ejected, this is one of the few indoor venues in las vegas where photography is not just allowed, but downright encouraged. that in itself is worth the rather steep pricetag.

all the figures are lifesized and painstakingly measured to look like the celebrity depicted, or at least somewhat like the celebrity. we had a whale of time sizing ourselves up to the celebrities, and getting photo ops that you wouldn't get anywhere else.

sadly, ms. lopez' likeness was under repair when we were there, but a rather fair-skinned version of beyonce stood in for her. my friend was satisfied. :)"
1488,"recently my garage door broke.  i knew exactly which parts needed replacing, so i sent a detailed email to about 8 local door repair companies requesting an estimate.  of the 8, only obar responded with an email that had a professional quote attached, with a breakdown of costs, presented on company letterhead with signature.  very nice.  2 others gave me a price via email, 1 other said he'd call (never did).  and the last 4? not a peep.

not only was obar the most thorough in their communication, they also ended up being the first ones available, with the lowest price.  rarely do you feel like you hit a home run.  but my garage door was fixed within hours, they were honest (no attempt to sell me a whole new garage door opener as one of their competitors did), and the price was great.

they have a customer for life."
1489,they understand when you are out of hot water you need it asap. i called in the morning and they said they would make sure they would have someone out to my place no later than 5pm. well i got a call around 12 and they said one of their plumbers was on the way to give my water heater a look. their plumber was super friendly and told me the financial aspects of getting the water heater repaired or replaced. since my water heater was 12 years old i knew it was best to just replace it. they did a great job for me and i'm sure they'll do the same for you too
1490,my ac unit stopped blowing cold air this past weekend.  i was able to get nick out to my place right away and he was able to diagnose and repair a bad capacitor in a matter of minutes.  it feels good again to have cold air.  it seems like ac units always break when we have record heat!
1491,have been using this business for years. can rely on them to do only needed repairs at fair price.
1492,went in to have my dyson repaired.   the fix was so simple they did it without charging. they helped me with how to clean my filters as well.  i would highly recommend this place to anyone!
1493,"great work, my google pixel xl was repaired to it's original quality. friendly staff that will give you plenty of options and insight."
1494,bummer. closed until the end of january 2012 for renovations.
1495,"jamie showed up on time, was very professional and pricing is very reasonable. will be using for future handyman work."
1496,"i would highly recommend john hindulak a professional repairman from las vegas sliding door repair. john has over 20 years experience in sliding glass doors and window repair an can save you money rather than replacing the door or window. john is reliable, trustworthy and dependable."
1497,"ray is one of the good guys. he came out to repair my refrigerator, replaced a part he had on his truck. he explained and showed me everything all at a fair price. he even called the next day to make sure things were running fine. i'd use this company again in a heartbeat."
1498,"i've been a customer here for a few years and have been satisfied with the facility and location in general. but i would like to mention they have a new onsite manager ""michael""  he is taking the job seriously and paying special attention to tenants needs. i was having a long term problem with a roof leak in my unit. i mentioned it to previous managers but nothing was done. after a big rain i showed him the evidence. he jumped right on it and quickly scheduled the repairs, including a couple of follow up calls with updates. i really appreciate the quick response and follow up."
1499,"i read the bad reviews on the company, but my experience was vastly different. my ac is old, and i really need a new one, but that's not an option right now. 

i had another company out here that wanted to charge a ton of money, but i ended up calling one hour. the first time they came out and i paid $200 and some change. the ac worked fine for a couple of months. 

i called them again, and this time the repair was $180 something, and we decided to get the membership at $240 or so. since then they've been out here 3 times and it hasn't cost a dime. since getting the membership, they've done over $700 in repairs and the techs have been great. 

sean is usually in and out super fast and has everything working again. eventually i'll buy a new system, and i'll most likely go through one hour to have it installed."
1500,had the boys out again and they delivered as usual. ed & taylor added a three outlets without me having to do any drywall repair. i can't say enough about these guys and this company. thanks again!
1501,we called about a garage door repair at 6 pm on a sunday night and by 8 pm ben was here working on the repair. he couldn't have been any more professional and efficient. this company was an extreme pleasure to work with!
1502,"quick and really inexpensive, very friendly staff, easy to find and the coupon for smog is unbeatable, we will return for all our regular maintenance and future repairs as well!!"
1503,i had a number of broadcast video decks that needed repair.  frank was able to fix most of them.  very knowledgeable - he really knows his stuff.  highly recommended!
1504,gordon is a nice guy - they do sprinkler repairs
1505,"got an estimate with andy good. hes super friendly and attentive. knows the answer to every question and   also gives his professional opinion when needed, then later had a repair done and felt the work was on point and the cost was very fair and reasonable :) great family business!"
1506,"mike is a great guy, very honest.  repaired my asanti rim until i get can more work done on it.

thank  you!"
1507,"had my rear bumper caved in on my 2012 ford fusion. used tom mortensen and his brother of ""colors on the run"" to repair it.
they came right to my garage and did an unbelievably fantastic job!!
they repaired the caved in bumper and painted it and it looks as though they put a brand new bumper on it!
can`t rave about these guys and the job they did enough!"
1508,"called for a repair quote and they were in the neighborhood. they stopped by 10 minutes after my call and gave me a very reasonable quote. quite friendly folks.

i didn't end up using them as i needed it done immediately and they were a couple days out to fit me in. 

if it weren't for the time crunch, i've no doubt they would have won the work. 

very friendly folks and incredibly responsive."
1509,we had bathroom redesign and repair do some work on both our showers. loved working with them! everything was done timely and to perfection! i highly recommend this company!!
1510,most of our money for our house renovations goes to this particular home depot. returns are easy with or without receipts. ro and i love this location. i especially like their text message discounts and coupons. cheers***
1511,"great experience. brought in my miele vacuum for repairs and the owner quickly diagnosed the problem, showed me the easy fix, and sent me off an my way without charge. will certainly return when my vacuum is actually broken."
1512,best place for motors and repairs i have found. go out of their way to save you money and only charge $15 for labor. won't go anywhere else.
1513,"i called desert home repair early morning and ed was out the same day to give me an estimate. the following day, my roof was repaired as well with pictures sent to me of the work before and after. ed was very prompt and efficient, as well as very friendly. i would highly recommend everyone i know to go through this company. if i could give more than 5 stars i would!!!"
1514,"brian, from usa blinds, was at our home today and repaired several of our plantation shutters. great job and fair price! highly recommend!"
1515,"i hired ths to repair the damage and terrible installation done by unscrupulous audio video and construction contractors (whom were later prosecuted by the state)   ths came in and transformed my home into a fantastic place to live in. their team of professionals worked on time, every time. the systems i purchased from them are supported flawlessly. i highly recommend them to anyone who wants to update their home up to the twenty first century. bravo!!!"
1516,"i highly recommend shay over at all-pro handyman. i messaged him early in the day to have my new t.v. mounted to the wall and he was able to come out that same night. i was impress with him because every other company i contacted was at least $70 more and they couldn't get to me until the following week. when shay came out he was very early, professional and finished hanging the t.v. in less than an hour. finding good and honest help in las vegas is very hard to come so i'm especially grateful i was able to find all-pro handyman. i will definitely be using them in the near future for more projects."
1517,"had a great experience with rocky, he was on time, professional and fixed my ice maker quickly. i will definitely keep this company in mind if i'm in need of another alliance repair. thank you!"
1518,"i am wary of people coming to my home to work on things because i have heard nightmare stories of workmen who damage things on purpose so they can stick you with a big repair bill.  

but i heard good things about this company from a friend and took a chance.  i was very relieved to deal with such an honest company.  everything went off without a hitch in a professional, customer oriented manner."
1519,this bar is the absolute perfect bloomfield spot. under renovation but still rocks. the bartenders are family and make you feel like family as well. the tunes are great and you are in a perfect location. indoor and outdoor areas and fun people constantly!! i love it!
1520,"the cashiers were friendly and tentative but the location needs some love. albeit, its a old location but some renovations should be in it's near future."
1521,"we needed new locks on our business, and i'm so glad we called jeff.  

on-time, extremely professional, and very friendly.  he was able to re-key all three doors, make us as many keys as he wanted (right from his van), and even did a little repair work on the door to get it to lock correctly.

all this in about an hour and for a very reasonable price!  thanks, jeff!!!"
1522,"these guys were awesome :) i had several plumbing repairs needed in my home and my home warranty company contracts with aaa for these repairs. there were several repairs not covered by my hw plan and they were honest, helpful, and precise about explaining everything. once i agreed to the repairs, they collected materials and were completed with the work within about 2 hours. all in all, i greatly appreciated their honesty and true hard work. it's clear this is a local, home-grown company that takes pride in the work that do."
1523,"valleywide handyman's rating is 5 stars. jaime was very polite, thorough & pricing was very reasonable. thanks jaime for helping me out!!"
1524,great experience with this company. had a tile blow fall off and had an area of dry rot on the facia which turned out to be from a leak. curtis came out and gave us an estimate and looked at other areas such as our patio cover and pointed out issuewa that might need attention. no pressure at all to get it done. when our roofer came out he did the repairs and cleaned up very well. he even painted the small area where the fascia was replaced in a color that was very close to what we had. this was not something promised or billed for. i thought our pricing was reasonable. i will call them again if we have a roofing issue
1525,"mr. faranesh is professional with integrity.  he is a man of his word and very responsive to the needs of tenants or homeowners.  he responds very quickly to all our needs.  he has a team of colleagues, contractors and handymen that do great jobs at reasonable cost.  i strongly recommend wasim faranesh to real estate buyers, sellers and owners for managing their properties."
1526,"super quick & friendly flat repair. other big o had a 3 hour wait, but here i got right in. i feel safe again. oh, and for free, thanks!"
1527,"hello all, does anyone know what happened to chou?  i pass by it the other day and it says they're closed for renovation...but i think it's been closed for a while now and nothing seems to be happening in terms of reno.!?"
1528,they have almost anything you would want from nuts and bolts to yard maintenance supplies. everything you need to maintain a home. the staff is friendly and help you find whatb you need. i couldn't recommend them more highly. they also have a full line of rental equipment for almost any home repair project you could imagine. try it you'll love it!
1529,"have used joe ciotta for our plumbing need for the last 20 years. from drain clogs to garbage disposal instillation to water  softner instillation and major repairs. have always been prompt and professional with fair prices. highly recommended.

1530,"ben came out to my home on sunday and did a great job. it was not an emergency repair, but they don't charge extra for weekend appointments so i agreed to the time. 

ben ended up adding a support bar to my door to make it run a lot smoother than it was before. he actually found out i had a faulty sensor that i didn't know about and the repair cost was very fair. i know that in the future if i have any garage door issues a always open will be the company i will call. thank you guys!!"
1531,"i have used these guys for 20 years. they have welded my tractor and created a custom front gate for my last house. they are currently welding up a gazebo for me and will be doing a couple more gates and some other projects at my new place.

this is truly an old-world resource that is so very hard to find any more. cave creek is so lucky to have these guys in town as a repair and fabrication resource. no wonder they are busy all the time. i highly recommend cave creek welding."
1532,this is my 1st time visiting here... currently the 2nd floor is under renovation. it is so cool that you can personalize m&m's instantly. would like to see more items that can only be bought here...
1533,"these guys are great! the owner has helped me out with my own a/c as well as several people i know over the last few years. 
the most recent was a good friend of mine who's a/c went out completely. his condo was rather old and the units were difficult to access and work with. he had called another company and was given a quote of $6500+ (no telling if more would be required once they got in there) to repair it and also told he'd have no warranty as there was no guarantee it would even work. he told me about it and we both knew that was unreasonable. 
i immediately contacted george for him who sent a guy out right away for an estimate. while it is true that there was unforeseen labor (a possibility we were made aware of), george still worked with us and at the end of the day, not only did they make the necessary repairs for less than half the cost of the other guys' orig estimate (including that unforeseen labor), he also warranted the parts and labor to ensure we have piece of mind that these repairs will last. the owner is a great guy who really wants to help people. he's not looking to get rich off of your misfortune. i would highly recommend them to anyone! (the techs were courteous as well.)"
1534,"our tenants managed to misalign the shower door in the masterbath so it wouldn't close.  we called around and couldn't find anyone willing to ""repair"" the door - other companies wanted to sell us a new door. 
kelly's agreed to repair the door and worked with us since we were only in town for a limited time.  they showed up when promised and quickly fixed the problem.  we highly recommend them."
1535,"erin extremely helpful, hooked me up with a shirt for work, ron the ticket writer a great talker, customers are smiling & buying,  beautiful day out, done 3 chip repairs!"
1536,holy cow! renovations are underway and it looks amazing. so clean. so organized and such a better selection!
1537,"it took a few times to complete the issue on my truck.  i felt the repair was fair and honest.  the owner went out of his way to make sure the job was done right and held off charging me until i called the follow week to confirm. 
thanks"
1538,"clean and stately.  renovations were underway, but the staff was accommodating.  beds were really comfortable.  high ceilings.  enjoyed my stay"
1539,i'm very happy with the repairs i received.  my chimney is now safe to use.  good honest friendly people.
1540,"thank you tyler....about a year in a half ago johnson roofing replaced partial roof - great job.  i contacted tyler as the refrigeration unit detached from the vent and i had thought it was from when they lifted the stand to re-roof.  tyler went out, repaired, explained what else needed to be done as former repair persons tarred the vent and unit, the problem was not caused by johnson roofing,...but he repaired it anyway, and was very pleasant.  i will call again when roofing needs to be done"
1541,"we visited after the restaurant reopened for summer renovations, and it was just as good as usual. i like it, but i maybe eat too much when i got there."
1542,"i first used new life roofing a couple of years ago when i had a leak.  of the four companies who came to look at it, new life was the only one honest enough to say that it could be repaired.  every other company tried to tell me i needed a new roof.  when i ha storm damage this week, i called on tuesday morning.  richard returned my call promptly.  he was at my house first thing wednesday morning and had a crew out early thursday morning to do the repairs necessary to make sure the roof would hold if there was another storm.  his crew was polite and accommodating.  i would not call anyone else for roofing repairs."
1543,"very good gym the only thing is some of the equipment not repaired fast enough.
few equipment is showing age just need refinishing."
1544,as a real estate agent i have referred west coast plumbing and air on several occasions and they have always gone the extra mile to provide my clients with honest and fair pricing. the technicians are always respectable and very knowledgable. i will continue to recommend them to all of my clients and of course i will continue to use them for all of my own personal repairs and maintenance. call wcpa you won't be disappointed!!
1545,great bbq. great atmosphere.  renovations are great.  super friendly staff.  did i mention great bbq?!
1546,"roti king was closed briefly for some renovations and now its open again, with a much warmer and nicer feel. love the channa roti! oh and ya its only $5!! excellent value for the price!"
1547,ed was absolutely amazing!! we called for an estimate and he was here within 30 minutes as promised. quoted and repaired our simple fix which i thought was gonna be a nightmare. he is very honest and won't rip you off trust me i been ripped off in the past. i'm gonna highly recommend him to all my friends and family. mahalo so much ed you are amazing!
1548,"prompt response, professional repair.  i have used them 5 times and have had no issues.  great company and technicians."
1549,great team ... friendly and very honest with the repairs that are needed.... thank you
1550,"i needed to replace a light fixture that broke in my bathroom. the original light cover was from the 80's, so i couldn't just order it from somewhere. so, i wound up hunting around for custom-cut pieces of plastic. i first went to menards and placed a special order for it. after one week of dogging them about my order status, still no word. so i went to home depot. a friendly guy there directed me to a huge sheet of plastic, but said that i would have to cut it myself. i tried, and the sucker shattered. my third stop was here to lowe's, where an equally friendly guy pointed me to the same piece of plastic, but actually tried to cut it for me. when it again shattered, we decided to go with plexi-glass and he cut it beautifully. did not even charge for the shattered plastic.

one thumb up for the employee spending 15 minutes with me finding what i needed, and the other thumb up for him cutting it as the other two places had refused to do. lowe's now has my home repair business for life.

not five stars because the place is just not user-friendly. between menards, home depot, and lowe's, i wandered around the most at lowe's."
1551,"my favorite handyman of all time!!!! my company hires valleywide handyman any time we need pictures hung, wall repairs/painting, fixing furniture - you name it, and he does it.  great personality, punctual and has a great eye for decorating. we've hired this company many times and have been very happy with all the work. spread the word - a true gem!"
1552,"quick, reliable and honest! go with shea fernandez, he's the best! repaired my side mirror, quoted 180, got it done for 100! rarely, have i seen repairs done lower than quote. saved me another 200 on a new mirror!"
1553,"i cant think of a more historical land mark then our own city hall. 
opened in 1965 and designed by finnish artist viljo revell, i really find the design of the building still relevant to this day, was able to get to do the ""doors open toronto"" experience, and i found it absolutely breath taking, as you can see in the photos i uploaded, this place has a lot of art, and the view from the top of the tower is amazing. 
if anyone reading this has an opportunity to actually do the inside of the building and see the inner workings, its awesome. 
generally speaking, i do believe its been open every doors open. 
lots of movies and t.v. shows have been filmed here, and a fair bit of renovations have been done over the year, it is also home to one of the largest green roofs in the city.
every time i come here i find a new portion of the building that i fall in love with, as well as finding the city of toronto logo with the outline of city hall is a wonderful homage to the building it self."
1554,amy and her staff's response time and repair time was amazing.  just a few hours from when i made the on line appointment with the home warranty company.
1555,"as a first time home buyer, i didn't know anyone to refer me to a contractor. so, i got several bids from contractors to renovate my dream home. lvr was not the lowest bid, but i was so glad i hired them. my dad is a veteran so i was happy to give work to a disabled veteran owned company.

joe & the rest of the lvr team handled my large renovation from start to finish. they were courteous, professional & really transformed my house into my dream house. 

i would recommend lvr to anyone looking for the real deal, old school contractors. these guys are that."
1556,"dragon ranch golf club has gone through a major renovation over the last few years and the course is now in stellar condition.    the greens are absolutely the best in the area and the fairways are in great shape.    it's a challenging course, tight fairways, lots of water and trees.   hole #8 is a particularly fun par 3 with an island green."
1557,had a great experience.  everyone was friendly and helpful and the repairs on my 3 series bmw were finished in a timely manner.
1558,great rates on rentals and very helpful staff!  i have also used them for repair on power tools. very reasonable and dependable!  my go to place for rentals and repair.
1559,did a great job fixing the door. would recommend to everyone. if you have any needs regarding door repair. don't hesitate
1560,"i had my roof done by this company and everything for the most part was smooth.  the roof came out nice the price was competitive and the sales person stayed in email contact with me.  the only bad thing that happened was the next year when i rained for the first time there was a leak in a vent on the roof, had to sit through about 2 days of bucket drips.  they came out about a week later and patched it up and no issues since then which is why the get a 4 for the fast repair in the work and if there want a leak i would be giving them a 5.  i would recommend this company but just ask at the end of the job for them to test the roof with a hose for leaks if possible."
1561,"outstanding!  this place is the absolute best!  everyone there is polite, professional, and the nicest people you will ever meet.  my mower repair was quick and top-notch!  i didn't even recognize my own lawnmower when i picked it up it was so clean.  highly recommended!"
1562,"all-pro handyman was one of the establishments i asked for a paint quote, and they were quick to respond as well. i think the one ""issue"" was more on the fiance's part because he had been the original person to ask for a quote before i offered to help look, and no one had responded to his e-mail request/inquiry. 
they also offered a reasonable estimate by looking through the photos that my fiance sent out."
1563,"david our tech is a hero!! boss plumbing came out as a second opinion referred to us by our home warranty company.. 

they made all necessary repairs to our bathroom and plumbing issues without a hitch.. 

this company came out within 2 hours of making the appointment on a saturday!  we truly appreciate them going out of their way to assist with our plumbing meltdown.. 

thank you, thank you, thank you!!"
1564,"don provided a 2 hour window and arrived early. he was absolutely professional and was fair in his pricing. what more could you ask for? well, after fixing my ac unit, he cleaned the vent and replaced air filters inside my home. he truly treats your home like his home. he kept in communication with me and even sent me pictures as i was at work (repair was for my rental property)."
1565,"scored some great sweaters on the $10.00 rack one time, although it could be a hit or miss depending on the day, but everything is very clean and repaired which is good."
1566,"i had a malfunctioning water softener. dave came out, analyzed the problem, found a cracked tank,  recommended a new unit and gave me a written quote for that and some other repairs. i researched it and agreed with his recommendation.

very soon, i had a nifty new softener and 5 new faucets outdoors. dave also found the leak in the softener's dump line (it was underground) and repaired it quickly.

i highly recommend merit."
1567,the ac went out in my in laws house  and let's face it it went from 77 to 98 degrees in 20 mins. we called autumn air and we got an amazing repair man named josh. he was friendly and knowledgable and was just down right amazing. he was at my in laws house at 830 am and had it fixed in an hour! just a wonderful experience! i recommend this company to everyone!
1568,"***update: i had already written a positive review before they emailed me asking me to write an honest review, well all i did was repost/update my first review and they just mailed me 2 free harkins movie passes for their appreciation!!***

i've been searching for a reliable and experienced roofer for a fairly small job on my house.  i had 4 roofers come by to give me estimates.  all i needed was some tiles replaced, about 50 of them.  one guy asked for $1600!  he also lied about the amount of repairs i needed, i felt like going up there myself, you never know what they're doing, if they're causing more damage, and who knows what they're charging you for.  the other one wanted a lot less but never showed up!  and the other two wanted me to wait weeks before they could start work!  i saw an ad on yelp for johnson roofing and gave them a call.  i told tyler what i needed, i sent him the pics, he emailed my estimate, and they were out the very next day to start working!!  the price he gave me, you wouldn't be able to find anywhere!!  everyone i talked to was just very nice and so pleasant to work with.  no hassles!!  no waste of my precious time!!  i wouldn't use any other company.  they're located in mesa but repair all over the valley (i live in n. phx near peoria).  i can't believe how quick they are, and i know they're extremely busy.  i appreciate them so much for taking time out to help people with smaller repairs."
1569,"communicated through text and email. ed was able to stop by a few hours after contacting but because of our busy schedule he gave an estimate the next day. he was even 30min early of the time stated. after a week and half of collecting 5 estimates from other roofers we chose dhr because the price was lower than even the average cost. he answered many additional questions we had of his estimate right away. 4 of our valleys needed to be cleaned (pigeon feces and pine needles), numerous tiles needed to be replaced and connected, he resealed all roof pipes/transitions, and secured tiles over the edge; all in one day. we had other roofers tell us our felt needed to be replaced but ed said it was ok for another 5yrs, which gives us time to save money since we just moved in. he's very honest and hardworking. definitely recommended for home repair. thank you again!"
1570,i contacted domestic landscape to fix a busted irrigation hose. bill and his team came in the next day and quickly and efficiently diagnosed and repaired the problem. the problem was more extensive than initially thought but he gladly completed the task without any extra charge. i've found a new yard guy.
1571,great company to deal with and very honest. thank you for the great job on my gutter and roof repair.
1572,"i had a great experience with this place. the repairs were done in a timely manner, they were upfront with costs and most importantly, they were friendly and professional. kelly and max did a great job making sure that i was informed with every step of the process. 

very satisfied!"
1573,"got one of those annoying chips in my wind shield yesterday. my experience says chips turns into cracks, so i acted quickly.called reliable at 3:30 yesterday and today by 10:30 tech arrives at my home (on time) and repairs in 15 minutes. steve was amazing! been using reliable for about five years and they continue to be ""reliable""."
1574,"thank you john barrett for being the only contractor/tile installer, out of many i called, to respond and do the repair job so quickly and efficiently. 

thank you to greg ordaz for doing the repair even though i know you are overqualified for such a small job.  you still treated it as if it were a major installation and took your time to make sure it was perfect! that is such a rarity these days, especially in las vegas. 

i am in the design business and finding quality people like this to do the labor after extensive time picking out your design choices is crucial to the final outcome.

i highly recommend this company.
class act!"
1575,best motel this side of the mississippi! it looks like they maybe have done some renovations but it was a very cozy stay.
1576,"repairs on your house are never fun! i needed an outlet outlet replaced & a friend gave keith's number   heath and his son zack came out and did the job in minutes! no nonsense, great guy!! i highly highly recommend these guys!"
1577,after seeing the reviews about city heating and air on nextdoor and google i decided to give them a call when our downstairs ac went out.   wow! is the one word that i can say!   adam was incredible.  came out the next day and explained everything as he was doing it.  he could tell i was somewhat of a handyman so he took the time to explain to me what he was doing and why!  he was extremely fair on his pricing and we will certainly call city for any future hvac issues!!
1578,"bathroom redesign & repair helped us remodel our home before we rented to move out of state. they helped us with 2 bathrooms and the kitchen and it came out great!!! we got to work closely with marla and her team and she helped guide us through the process. we did provide a lot of our items but that helped with us having freedom to change what we wanted. the tile in the bathrooms and the counter tops in all areas look amazing! we had all new custom cabinets in both bathrooms and kitchen, too. i couldn't be happier with the stain, layout - everything! 

they did the work on budget and they arrived on time every day and explained every part to us. her team was very clean, kind and thoughtful. we love our new remodel and wish we had more to love it but our renters are ecstatic about the remodel and no issues! thank you br&r for helping make our home lovely not for just us, but others too! : )

*i want to insert photos but i'm not sure how, sorry!*"
1579,"this company completed a repair for me when called by my home warranty company. they responded quickly and vacuumed out my ac drain line instead of just blowing it out so the line was completely cleared. the technician was polite, professional and appeare to know what he was doing. i would definately use themm again."
1580,"wow this is as good as it gets. perfect garage door repair. swapped out the old unit with a new one. perfect installation, thank you eric. it is so quiet and so smooth. couldn't ask for more. quick turn around and great communication too. 5 stars!!"
1581,"steve did such a great job helping us fix multiple issues in our new home. he is professional, skilled, friendly and easy to work with - he cheerfully handled our projects and the cost was right with the estimate. added project costs were explained, fair and kept within budget. there was no shaming about needing a handyman from this company! quick response time and always right on time for appointments! great company!"
1582,"thank you, luis, for making our commercial heater work again!  all of the employees were all freezing until you came and repaired it for us :)  very professional and upfront about costs.  we will definitely do business with luis again!"
1583,"dave was my technician. he was incredibly professional and quickly troubleshot and resolved a variety of issues with my sprinkler system. i am a diy guy (with no prior sprinkler repair knowledge) and tried fixing it all myself for weeks with no luck (replaced the manifolds, fuses, etc.), so i greatly appreciated him explaining to me the steps he was taking as he performed them. in hindsight i wish i had called him at the very start of my problems.

based on my experience today i would highly recommend this company. my experience was good enough that i will also be contacting their sister company, vip landscaping, if i have any landscaping needs in the future. thank you dave!!"
1584,"i  brought in my son's guitar case to be repaired.  the handle had come off one side.

1587,i have been having my heels repaired here for as long as i can remember.  this guy works magic.  he is quick and cheap and the best!!!
1588,"it's a perfectly good library... why all the hate? sheesh.

unlike most libraries it is open 'til 8:30 pm most days of the week, making it very convenient. the building is nice, the location is great, and there is lots of room.

pretty soon it will be shutting down for a major renovation (although they keep putting it off...)"
1589,i contacted down under plumbing last night regarding a leak from my water softener. rob was able to come first thing this morning. after checking the problem he quickly went to work and repaired the issue. very happy using down under plumbing and i will continue to use them for all of my plumbing needs.
1590,"i'm applying here now, was a little deterred by the bad reviews but after seeing the new renovations decided to split anyways. the atmosphere seems really nice and everything looks well kept. it's really close to unlv and really reasonably priced. i'm excited to move in."
1591,"leo at l & s air is the best!  the a/c at my house was blowing hot air, got an estimate from one hour a/c who came out and said the compressor was bad and would be $1500 but recommended to buy a whole new unit for $3,000+! wanted a second opinion so called l & s and they came out and were able to repair it for under $200!  wow! so great to have honest companies out there who don't want to take advantage of average consumers. thank you l & s!!!! highly recommended!!!!"
1592,"my hvac system is over 30 years old so every year i have to call a repair firm. bash is the quickest and very reasonable. they also never take advantage of the age of my system with a sales pitch. this morning there was water all over the basement floor (clogged drain ac pipe). they came within 20 minutes, fixed the problem and refused payment since they had been here last week to fix an unrelated issue. i love these guys!"
1593,"they returned our call regarding vertical blinds not functioning properly.  he came by our place and was able to get cleats to open and actually move.  best of all, he arrived early did repairs in house was very knowlegable."
1594,"very quick to respond, extremely competitive pricing, the repair came out amazing and the facilities were top notch."
1595,so they have done the renovations... meh... but the pizza was still spectacular! i am a thick crust pepperoni and cheese fanatic! when i get that evil crazy craving monster... this round table pizza is the one that makes the monster go away.
1596,kevin did an incredible job on my range rover's leather repair and pillar repair.  looked original!  i also had a nasty stain that was resilient on white leather and he kept on it until it was satisfactory!  definitely would recommend!
1597,"after another floor refinisher almost ruined our saltillo tile floors, we searched for someone who could repair the damage and re-do the floors.  we were so fortunate to find bruce tomson and tomson floor finishing!  after the damage that was done by the previous floor refinisher, we didn't think there was much chance that the floors would ever look good again.

but bruce, who has more than 30 years of experience working exclusively with saltillo tile, did a fantastic job!  he took the time to strip every single tile all the way down to the raw tile.  he thoroughly cleaned both the tile and the grout.  then he waited several days for the floor to thoroughly dry before applying sealer.  this is an important step!  if the sealer is put on before the floor has thoroughly dried, you get many problems including white mineral residue.

we believe that very few people in the phoenix area have bruce's knowledge about saltillo tile, and even fewer will take the time - as bruce did - to do a thorough job.

his prices were fair, and he was easy to work with.

our floors are beautiful now, and we will enjoy them for many years to come!  you can't go wrong with tomson floor finishing.  if we could give 10 stars, we would."
1598,when i lived in las vegas i tried several handymen and it was a disaster. then i found jamie and he was the best to get all of my jobs done. i would like to add five more stars to this rating. i now live in oklahoma and i would only trust jamie to get the job done.  i would also like to thank jamie for all of the work he has done for me in the past.
1599,i choose this company to fix my roof.   5 year warranty provided.  i now have a leak where i need it repaired.. i think it is a simple repair.   i have left 3 messages.   we will see how they respond.  i sure hope i get better results than one of the reviews mentioned.   will update review in a few weeks.
1600,"thommy and terry were very helpful and quick to respond and act on my problem. got the quote, they came to look at it, and fix the window in less than 48 hours. best rate i could get amongst other glass repair places in the area. would definitely recommend!"
1601,"unbelievable turnaround on a transmission install, actually 27 hours from when my 2001 echo rolled off the truck. road trip turned layover turned great overdue repair. thanks to all! (i felt guilty that maybe someone else got bumped.)"
1602,"jason recently helped us sell a house in vegas. he's very responsive and helpful. we live out of town which prevented us from actively getting involved in the repair, remodel, and selling process. jason helped us find the contractors, collect the bid, follow through the work, updating us every step of the way. he's knowledgeable and trustworthy. definitely highly recommended!"
1603,kyle came over to check out oven and he was amazing! very knowledgeable! would definitely use him again if we need another repair!
1604,"handyman jamie serwatka arrived promptly and completed my minor job in a very organized and efficient manner (about 30 minutes)!  i needed help taking apart my oven door panel so  i could clean in between the glass, and after checking online for basic information, he was able to disassemble and reassemble it all in a matter of minutes.  no missing screws afterwards either!  his charge was surprisingly reasonable, and i'll certainly call him again as needed!  thanks, jamie!!!  :)"
1605,"as a senior citizen about to complete his umpteenth (and final) move, it was important to me to find a qualified home inspector. my realtor recommended fred roach, and i could not be happier. he was extremely thorough and provided important details and photos in the report. he also provided a list of trusted contractors who can do the necessary repairs. fred is highly recommended."
1606,"they fit me in as soon as possible. very thorough initial inspection & discussion of options for raccoon trapping & removal, then repair of access points, and clean-up & sanitizing of attic areas. expensive but comparable to similar vendors in the area.
there was a little confusion about the billing (due to me not clarifying beforehand) but they resolved it fairly quickly."
1607,i've rented from this company for a year now and they have been awesome! anytime i needed a repair they were here so quickly and then kortnie (super sweet) would do a follow up email to make sure the work was done to my satisfaction. i'm so grateful to have a rental company that is courtesy and professional.
1608,"they are the best, ross in repairs to sales person. they tell want is the truth about a product, not always what you want them to say. they are very knowledge about all the information that is needed to made a good choice on a product you may wish to buy."
1609,"i took my dyson animal that i paid $600 for and had used for 5 years.  i was close to buying a new vacuum but i'm so glad i chose to repair!  this place does incredible work.  when i got home, i felt like a had a brand new $600 vacuum!  i bet this thing will last another 5 years!  amazing!  i highly recommend this place!"

(and of course tuned it as well) finally my piano is whole after 15 years. thanks to fred!!
1612,"i love this place. why? because they have repaired everything i've brought them. they did so incredibly quickly. and the repairs were well done. they are very pleasant, which is a perk, but not necessary in my book. i would go no where else."
1613,"i must be honest, we had a great start. scott answered my request for an estimate promptly. assigned a technician, fernando, for the time that i requested. rough middle, the technician didn't call and i was waiting past the promised time. but scott apologized profusely, the technician called me almost immediately to apologize and rescheduled, the reschedule blew, then the great work began. i was promised reduced(free) labor costs for my trouble. the repair turned out to be more...way more than expected but scott stood by his word of the reduced labor. the work was above and beyond what we had originally discussed. yeah, man thorough.  great technician! great company! would recommend them, hands down, to everyone and anyone who asks. sorry about the late posting."
1614,"responded very fast, removed all the water and used huge dryers to remove moisture from the room.  event helped finding contractors to repair the walls, cabinets, etc."
1615,have been buying from ace for over 25 years. beats driving 15 miles to home depot for the basic stuff you need for diy home repairs.
1616,amazing work! if he doesn't think he can do them perfect then he doesn't take them. he knows his stuff! im so happy with my heels that i thought were beyond repair. would recommend to anyone.
1617,"i recently had a brick thrown through my window, and couldn't get a window repair company out for 6 days at the soonest. i found stop and they showed up to my house in 40 minutes and had it temporarily boarded up until i could get it fixed. the guys were extremely professional and made it so quick and easy. highly recommended!"

1619,"we were all set on purchasing a new standard fridge for our kitchen remodel until we discovered this warehouse. we picked out a sub-zero and asked to have the doors finished with chalkboard paint, something they'd never done before, but they happily made it happen. after install we had some repairs, but each time they were quick and courteous! i trusted them in my house even when i couldn't be there too. i hope to do business with them in the future!"
1620,"this is the first time i have been very impressed by a knowledgeable and helpful a/c repair company.  he got my a/c cooling quickly, and gave me some very important tips on cooling our condo down in the summer and saving us quite a bit of money doing it.  thank you!"
1621,"meticulous work, prompt, creative and reasonably priced. these workers showed up for an emergency situation exactly when needed. i hired them for another job and they again did not disappoint. for me they did a ceiling and wall repair that had been water damaged. they then installed cabinets for me and finished them off beautifully. i would not hesitate to hire them again for any other job around the house."
1622,"highly recommended. eric the manager is friendly, professional, and no upselling. 

i have confidence they give me the straight scoop on what needs to be repaired and why."
1623,"john came out to repair my very old sliding glass door in my master bedroom. it was installed in the 1970s and wouldn't close correctly. he had to find the moulding which had been discontinued from the manufacturer. he found it and installed it a couple days later. he was quick, professional and it cost what he said it would cost. great job all around!"
1624,i continue to take my minivan to aaa for maintenance & repairs. it's always a great experience.
1625,"the pizza is soooooo good, i've had it a few times now. the ingredients are fresh and the crust is to die for. the owner is very friendly and will take a moment to tell you all about his pizza if it's not busy. if you're craving pizza i highly recommend this place. it iunder renovation as of now but i wouldn't let that discourage you from coming in because the tables you eat at are clean."

1628,"been living here for a year and a half. leasing and maintenance have been very helpful. repair orders are done quickly and the building is well maintained. some of the new security aren't as friendly. overall, above average happy."
1629,wow!  these guys really know their stuff. excellent response to our call about a problem with our humidifier. apparently the electrician screwed up the power connection which they found and fixed. they even provided a new tank from old stock for free and they balanced the air handler for much better flow to the rooms we use. they are trained and equipped to repair and set up very complex heating and air systems. most contractors couldn't handle some of the stuff these guys do. thanks so much for a very professional job. nascair is number 1 in the area on angie's list and they sure show it.
1630,"my folk's garage door opener broke late yesterday.  i contacted travis at 8:30 this morning, he arrived shortly after and made the repair in under 30 minutes for what i consider to be a very reasonable price.  the large, well-reviewed company here locally wasn't able to send out a repair person for 3 days!  we are completely satisfied with meinholz overhead door and will use them again should the need arise."
1631,"kyle, fixed an old kitchen cabinet drawer that i had not been able to find parts for.  that repair saved one hundreds of dollars on replacing the whole cabinet. while he was here i was having some doors replaced and one of the doors was not opening right so he made that work to. thank you for being so detailed in your work. you will be glad you called kyle. we recommend him highly!"
1632,"great experience that exceeded my expectations. super fast, super friendly. cody, who helped us, gave my 2 year old a plushy to play with while we were waiting. when we were ready to leave cody let him keep it. so sweet!
the repairs were completed faster than expected. 
overall, awesome!
:)"
1633,"i dealt  with numerous repair men for my old dryer, and then bought a new dryer that still didn't work before realizing it was clogged ducts. jeremy scheduled me in within a couple of days. he was informative and professional. he did arrive later than was scheduled but made sure to call to inform me that a prior job was larger than expected. the job was done within an hour and now my dryer is working perfect. the price can't be beat either."
1634,great! a bit expensive but they know their stuff!  the hours of operation are a bit limited so be prepared. i will return with any repairs i need in the future.

as a customer, keep in mind that high winds can delay a project:-)

ask for scott lewis!"

1642,"very professional, quick and friendly. i came in at 8:25am and was out in less than 10min. their lobby/waiting room is inviting.

the only issue, (purley cosmetic) i noticed the epoxy wasn't cleaned up as i can see a blob of it around the chip, but at $19 for the repair i'm not going to worry about it too much."
1643,"david was fantastic, came and did what i asked him to do, told me some ways to save money and left without trying to sell me on things i didn't need. even though there was a slight problem with the readings of one of the valves and he could have easily turned it into a several hundred dollar job he said cost wise it was better to use it as is then spend the money right now to fix it. that's my kind of a/c repairman.

highly recommend david and goodyear air conditioning & heating."

1650,"i recently used arizona trade masters to fix my heater through my home warranty company.  i had never heard of arizona trade masters soo obviously googled them and read the reviews on yelp the day they were coming out to assess my heater.  after reading the negative reviews, i was a bit worried about how my experience was going to play out.   my experience was nothing short of stellar.  arizona trade masters called the day of the appointment to confirm and again to inform me they were on the way.  the repairman who arrived was friendly and professional. he immediately found out what was causing my heater to no longer work and informed me of the next steps.  unfortunately they needed to order a part to he replaced.  arizona trade masters called me the same day to tell me when the part would be in and scheduled an appointment for that morning.  the repairman who arrived to install the part to fix my heater was again friendly and professional.  he fixed my heater in no time.  afterwards he explained what was wrong with my heater and asked if i had any questions which he was gracious enough to answer.  i have heat again thanks to arizona trade masters....i will definitely use them again!!!"

1653,"i've used glendale roofing numerous times over the past 10+ years and they have always been honest and never let me down.  their pricing is fair and their work is exceptional... from a repair they did 13 years ago to a full roof replacement they did this year.  they are a small company with limited roofing staff so if it is not an emergency repair, expect a wait until they can get to you. but they will, and they are worth the wait!"
1654,i have lived here for many years and absolutely love it. gated community with overnight security. lots of trees in a quiet neighborhood. repairs are handled quickly!
1655,"after waking up on a sunday morning to a cold house, i started to panic.  new heater?  if not that, how much for the repair?  my husband and i called kevin and we quickly to try to get on monday's schedule of calls, and we were surprised with his return call an hour later.  he talked us through what the possible problems were and instructed us on something we could do to fix the sensor.  it worked!  kevin saved us a fair amount of money.  he's also gained our trust and he'll be receiving our business from now on!  thanks, kevin!"

1663,"there is only 2 baseball fields and a large playground, nothing else. there is a renovation planned for fall 2019. everything is gated which is good. only street parking."
1664,"we had sections of our relatively new flat roof redone by johnson roofing in april after a storm. there were 7 areas with 7 drains that were redone.

1667,"after another company wired my system wrong, blew fuses, and left my system a mess.  a1 mitchell came to the rescue.  they were able to figure out and undo what the other company did and get my a/c running.  they didn't just repair it, they took the time to go thru my whole system and trouble shoot to make it was top notch.  they even found something that was missed by the other company and repaired it.  
kudos to edgar who was not only a good guy, but a great a/c repairman."
1668,"i had a hard deadline to get my ac repairs completed due to selling my house and kevin not only was able to get the job done in time, including going above and beyond to ensure the work was completed in time, but in phase also came in at several thousand less than the other companies i had spoken with. kevin and his daughter who works with him were also both highly professional and personable, they clearly grasped the concept that this isn't just a job, there are real people who live in these homes and making conversation while getting the job done not only makes the home owner feel acknowledged but also builds confidence. i would highly recommend in phase, and will use them for any future repairs i need."
1669,"very professional. called before arrival, appraised the situation, repaired the problem and charged less than quoted. very good experience and would not hesitate to use again."

1675,"i had a water heater issue.  called saturday afternoon, they came out the next morning.  received text messages with contact info and the name of the repair person.  hanz called when he was on his way in the 2 hour appointment window.  he was able to diagnose the problem and i would need a new water heater.  rescheduled for the next day for removal and new install.  

hanz called first and arrived in the allotted time.  water heater got removed.  i had a unique situation, without going all into it, i just want to thank hanz and manager saul for all their help.  hanz especially went above and beyond, he was very professional and very good at what he does."
1676,"amazing-very happy with tim and his company! no wonder he is the only glass repair company that has all/the most 5 star reviews (thank you fellow yelpers!)! we discovered our kitchen window had a leak and started developing condensation between the two panels (see before/after photos). i called paramount glass and mirror and tim came over that afternoon for an estimate. he was reasonably priced, courteous, professional and pleasant to work with! from the start, you could tell he knew his glass and how to repair it. i couldn't believe he called the next day to see if he could come over to fix the window!! our window looks like it never had any problem-and all done within 24 hours!  we highly recommend him to our family, friends and fellow yelpers! thank you, tim!"
1677,"as a restaurant manager, i've contacted and dealt with many ac companies but air done right stood out and and got the job done right in a timely manner. they responded fast, came out fast and repaired everything fast at a reasonable price. our technician mark was very professional and explained everything to me before he started the job unlike some companies that just repair first and charge ridiculous amount later. highly recommend this company and mark."
1678,"a-authentic technician, david, is a knowledgeable technician.  our garage door had multiple repair issues.  four struts were added to give stability to an old door.  the new belt drive is extremely quiet, which we appreciate.    we also had a new keypad entry installed.  david had done repair on our other garage door about 3 years ago. he is very professional and has repaired garage doors for 12 years.  he's the one to ask for if you have any issues with your garage doors."
1679,"matthew is a class act. after being jerked around by the first repair guy i called, matthew came  in and saved the day. he came in and provided me with different options to take to fix my refrigerator. he made a recommendation on the best approach to take, i approved it and he fixed it .... plan and simple! he did not give me the run around, he did not jerk me around, he was honest, respectful and professional. he even called me a few days after to check up on how things were going with the fridge. 

not only will i use him again in the future, but i would not hesitate to recommend him to any of my friends or family members who are in need of a honest repair guy who knows his stuff."

highly recommended."
1682,"my door was pretty beat up - gets a lot of sun, and the last person to do it didn't do it properly.  
josh and assistant came by, put plastic on the front door and set up a tent outside the house.  they were on time, professional and did a great job!  i noticed a slight bubble a few days later and called the company.  a fellow came out, said it was no problem and made an appointment to repair it.  josh and assistant came out again, took the double door down and repaired it.
no hassle, no attitude.  my door looks like new - and that is a quote from a few people!
thanks - it's good to know there are people who take pride in their work.
joyce"

1684,"i chose aliison due to all the rave reviews and i'm not sorry!  

before selling my house, though, i needed her to find me a rental.  she spent a lot of time with me and was very patient with me.  she was understanding of my decision to stop the process on one rental that i started having second thoughts about. after that i felt she was easy to work with so i had no qualms about  having her as my realtor to sell my house.  
bottom line, she was so helpful in staging my house, in suggesting workers to do jobs that came up, like handyman repairs, electrical, a/c issues, etc.  she had a suggestion or solution to any and all issues that arose---and there were tough ones.  and she walked me through all the paperwork and made it easy. she was always available and quick to respond.  i had great confidence in her and am happy that she was at my side through what i considered a daunting process.  
thanks again, allison, for going above and beyond the call of duty!"

1686,i've owned 3 homes and never had a sliding glass door that glided as easily as our door after john repaired it.  excellent work !  i called and made an appointment for several days later.  he kept the appointment and called to let me know he was going to be a little late.  then he took his time and fixed a door that needed a lot of work.  his price was reasonable.  great experience all around.  definitely worth it.

1689,"if you're in need of repair or replacement, david is your guy! when our garage door broke, i reached out to a handful of favorably rated companies via yelp! david of garage door solved/ king garage doors was one of the few who took time to reply. within days, he stopped by to assess our options and provided us with a fair quote. not only was his cost reasonable, he was able to replace our door within days rather than the weeks we were quoted by others. david was courteous and professional, keeping in communication with us throughout the process. he'll be the first person we call should misfortune meet our garage door again. thanks, david!"

1710,"i'm a huge fan. contacted this company for a fairly simple repair that i hadn't gotten to and they took a look at the photos first (because i had little free time); unlike many other companies that wouldn't even look and just wanted to send out a tech.  once they reviewed the pics, they responded with a money saving diy solution. a few weeks later and i've fixed it myself with a minimal investment.  i appreciate this kind of honesty and would use them for my future needs."

1721,"called jamie again third time for a third household issue needing repair. he is always very responsive and does an excellent job. it's kind of a catch 22 though because since he's so good, he's getting pretty busy. however, i will wait to use jamie rather than take a chance on someone else. thanks jamie"

1725,"free estimate, great competitive pricing, and a warranty for the repair.  i was scheduled quickly, they arrived a little earlier than expected and got the job done fast and showed me pictures throughout the process.  i will definitely hire them again if i need any additional work done to my roof. very professional and courteous, cleaned up after themselves."

1730,"i called to get someone out to look at my gas logs as they would not turn on with the remote.  the pilot was on and i was getting a red light on the remote.  they suggested i may need batteries in the receiver which i never thought of.  it worked and saved me money and them time!  if i ever need repairs, they have a new customer."
1731,"i can't say enough about dave and his crew. my husband and i were planning a small renovation that did not include new countertops but once we started we realized that new counters were a must! we had used dm countertops in a previous home so naturally i called them up again to see if they could help. dave was quick to come out 2 days later for an estimate. he was able to get us in the books quicker than anticipated which was so appreciated! the day of, his crew showed up on time and quickly got down to business. they made sure to keep us in the loop through out the whole process. the counters turned out amazing and everyone is blown away by how it changed the whole look of our house. we would recommend them time and time again for anyone looking for great quality work with a stand up company."

1734,"i will absolutely recommend h&i!
after having work done on my sequoia at another establishment, it just felt off to say the least. i called h&i and took it in. ryan rode tested it with me and could tell right away i was not crazy. i brought it in the next day, due to being later in the day when we rode tested it, to diagnose. they were able to diagnose and repair immediately! they also caught another mistake the other establishment messed up on and corrected it. it is now roadworthy again for much less than i anticipated!
thank you h&i, you have gained my trust and i will tell everyone to see you!"
1735,"dale can do it all. i've been a client of his for about a year now. he's professional, responsive, and highly knowledgeable. i've yet to ask him about something he couldn't fix. he's installed a range hood, hung heavy mirrors, installed curtain rods, fixed doors, done drywall repair, etc. whenever something around the house comes up-- and it inevitably always does-- i know dale will respond quickly, handle the issue comprehensively, and do it efficiently and affordably. i'm so happy i found dale."

1738,"one heck of a handyman. it took less than 2 days to put up a wall, install 2 new ceiling fans indoors, and outdoors. he is very attentive to customer specifications, requirements, and has attention to detail. we took a chance on jr without any reviews here on yelp, only based on his photos. we could not be happier. this is your guy, if you want to get your next home improvement job done right the first time. we have a few more improvements to make, and we will definitely be using jr improvements again. as a home owner, one must always have a great handyman on his side. jr is that handyman."

1741,"as a customer of credit absolute, my wife and i could not be happier. derick and his team are extremely knowledgeable and professional. they are truly unique in the way they approach credit repair - their way actually works, and you only pay for results after the initial consultation. the cost is nothing compared to what you will save with better credit. with a 98% success rate, you can't go wrong."

1743,"this is the first time dealing with shaffer & sons. they were referred to us by our warranty company after another a/c company unsuccessfully attempted the repairs. schaffer & sons sent their crew out the same day to give a second opinion and diagnose the problem. even though it took the warranty company some days to approve and order the replacement compressor, amy and the shaffer & sons team again came out the same day the compressor was available from the warranty company warehouse. our house is cool and comfortable again thanks to shaffer & sons and it was a pleasure working with amy and her team!"
1744,"bill m.
this review is overdue but better now than never.  we had a small repair done by shaffer & sons, sent by home warranty. not long after a major repair was needed, home warranty said manufacturer should cover so they refused to cover repair.  we had a battle between home warranty and manufacture, unit installed 3/12, we purchased home 7/12; warranty was never transferred to us, so no active warranty on file.  
amy,from shaffer & sons was instrumental to get the repair settled.
home warranty did cover the repair and amy did make sure it was done priority.  without amy's help we may still be waiting for one of the companies to cover the repair.  we say thank you to amy and her techs for a great job done for us!!  
your company is tops to us!!!"
1745,"fast, friendly, informative, and affordable! derek always explains all options for repairs. great location as well!"

1748,"we have 2 garage doors. in march, perry at a-authentic fixed our primary door. today he was able to diagnose the problems and repair our secondary door. the equipment on this door is 30+ years old, however perry provided needed repairs without unnecessary upsell. the door is more stable and much quieter when it opens. he also provided an estimate of what should be done when our old ""lifter"" finally fails.
appreciate him being on-time, knowledgeable and extremely personable."
1749,"repair technician was fast, courteous and very honest. did not try to sell me something i didn't need to get my air conditioning working again. showed me exactly what was going on and gave me realistic options. highly recommend!"
1750,"the cord broke on a very large honeycomb-style shade (72 x 59 inches), leaving it impossibly lopsided. not keen on spending hundreds $$ to replace it, i called blinds usa. jeffrey came by for an on-time appointment two days after i called and did a fantastic job replacing the cord. it's as good as new and cost me way less than i would have paid for a new shade. and he did the job right there in my home. yay jeffrey!

if you're anything like me, you'll try to repair, rather than replace, something that's in reasonably good condition. to my knowledge, no other place in town does this kind of repair. i'm so glad i found blinds usa. (note: they go by a couple of other names too.)"
1751,we had a1 mitchell come out to repair our ac system through our home warranty program. while it took longer than we would've liked for the part to come in once it got here they were very thorough and got it fixed in a timely manner. the technician that came out who i think was named ken was so knowledgeable about the unit and explained what they did on repair. we were very impressed and would recommend them.

1753,"my dog has been going to booboo for over a year now. talis does a great job on her, and he always calls me if there are any issues so i have a peace of mind. my dog always looks so cute after grooming, and her fur becomes extremely soft! she also doesn't appear stressed at all. the place is clean and inviting, and it became even better after the renovation. the online booking system on their website is easy to use and navigate."
1754,"i'm not big on contractors and repair guys. you usually feel like whatever the outcome you're going to get hosed. not with this company. phil came out and he was super honest friendly and helpful.  he had many opportunities to upsell me, instead he educated me on ways to save money. 

thanks"
1755,tom was a great help. i was in and out in no time and i didn't feel like i left with a laundry list of unnecessary repairs.

1758,"renting a home and the owners have a home warranty.  we reported a problem with the air conditioner not cooling and we were told that l & s was going to call to schedule an appointment for repair.  being new the phoenix area, we have not had any history with this company.  i loaded yelp and looked at previous reviews, which were not good.  i definitely did not have a good feeling about l & s being the company chosen to repair the ac unit based on these reviews.  they scheduled the appointment the following morning between 8 & 12.  at 8 am, we were called and told the technician should be no more than 20 minutes out.  the technician justin arrived within ten minutes of the call.  he replaced the fuses and the condenser fan in the outside unit.  he cleaned up the work area and everything seems to be working fine.  i could feel cold air blowing out of the unit immediately.  pleasantly surprised with this experience based on the reviews posted previously.  24 hour down-time for ac unit.  total time for repair was under 2 hours."
1759,"chris and his crew did an excellent job installing a dry stacked stone wall, dry river bed, flagstone walkway, decorative stone and boulders on my property. they were very professional and polite. chris kept me updated on his schedule on a daily basis and finished the job to my complete satisfaction. everything looks great. i would definitely recommend barnhardt landscaping & design for your landscape needs. 
chris also repaired and replaced several irrigation heads for me.
chris was very easy to work with and so was his crew."

1765,"they fixed my vintage 80's technics turntable for about $60 ($25 up front to estimate, which went towards the repairs). the estimate took a day, the repairs another day. works perfectly now. they seemed very honest and eager to do a good job. the only thing is that they're only open from tues - fri but if you can work around that schedule, i highly recommend them for repair work."
1766,was quick and easy. price was reasonable for repairs and they located in two areas of town that i frequent.
1767,"great experience with the l & s las vegas.  jeremy was great, very professional and responsive.  he explained everything and set the expectations for getting my system fixed.  he showed up in the expected time frame and was able to assess the problem.  he was also the same person who showed up to do the follow up repair.  so the whole experience was very positive. thank you jeremy!"

1771,"my husband and i were recommended after being turned down for a home loan. i'm so glad we took the initiative to give this company a try! i am definitely impressed, and not disappointed in the least. i reached out to the company about 6 months ago and spoke to rolo- who was super cool and understanding. he made some easy low hanging fruit suggestions, and also looked into our credit report. he took time to explain what everything meant, and what he could do for us. prior to coming to fscrs we had tried 2 different credit repair companies with little to no success for double the price that he was charging. i was impressed with his prices and didn't think twice about giving him a chance! i'm glad we did!

with his help, the credit bureaus removed some of the older credit inquiries which were affecting our score. rolo was able to coerce the credit bureau to remove the oldest ones, which instantly gave our score a bump. just this month we got a credit point increase of 110+ combined between my husband and i!!

i feel like this company has integrity and is always willing to help. props to this company and especially to rolo for being super understanding and helping us through the process of soon becoming first time house owners! i highly recommend him!"
1772,our fridge stopped working overnight and we woke up to water all over the floor and all of our groceries ruined. i called this place and within 45 minutes a tech named manny showed up. he was so friendly and knowledgeable about our repair! he explained everything to me and fixed everything in an hour. i would highly recommend him to fix what you need. even my dog approved of him!
1773,i always go here to get my jewelry repaired and clean. alex is super friendly and kind!
1774,have ge refrigerator that was leaking again.  called same ge repair company that had replaced same part just one year earlier.  gave me the run around and said they'd be out in a week or so.  called this company and they came out next day to investigate.  brought needed part the next day and fixed it.  totally professional and friendly.  highly recommend.
1775,"pretty good products. i have the refiner and a reverse osmosis system. so far, both have been good. as expected, the filters need to be replaced on a yearly basis for the ro system. i think the pricing is a tad high though. the installation for both was a little less than desirable. recently had a water heater repair and the guy commented on the refiner installation and how the connections seemed stressed out, noting how a few more angle adapters could make it better and safer from water leaking. not too enthused to hear this but it is what it is. it's been a few years since install so i don't want to bother with it now."
1776,"zen windows replaced my windows and sliding door throughout my condo. this was, by far, the best experience i have ever had working with a company on home repair/remodeling/etc. brian & his team made the process stress free and there were absolutely no surprises. i referred my parents and they have a wonderful experience as well! i highly recommend this company & wish that others would model their work ethic & quality after zen windows!"
1777,"jamie was on time, responsive, helpful and honest. i will certainly call on him for my home repair needs in the future."
1778,these guys did a good job. they handled the repair / replacement and painting of my fence in a timely and professional manner.  i had several competitive quotes and these guys had the best plan of action at a reasonable cost.  they made sure the job was completed and finished to my satisfaction.  would not hesitate to recommend this crew.
1779,honest opinion of the owner when i brought in my suitcase for repair.  said it was worth it to go buy a new one instead of the costly repair.    honesty matters.
1780,"quick & easy booking but came late but were still cheap af so i didnt cancel. the other repair companies charged too much for samsung dishwashers like way too much. figured id jus get a new washer then, ez fix asked for $20 less on the call out fee. i was sold. elio""s total was affordable and we went with him. he did have the part on hand & fixed it quickly. elio is a friendly guy and his daughter lilly helped with my billing questions too. i will use em again if something happens again."
1781,"matt found more than excessive lint in our dryer...wrong construction of exterior venting!  gave us referrals for roof repair and dryer clean out people...all will b fixed in a matter of days!  thank you, matt.  could have had a fire if he hadn't warned us not to use dryer until repaired! very professional. will continue with matt for yearly clean outs."
1782,"rich and his son did an excellent job making the repairs to the walls and ceiling in our home. he was able to come out the next day after he gave me a quote and fixed everything we talked about plus fixed additional things just to make sure everything looked good for paint. the cost was very fair for the amount of work they had to do, i will be using them again."
1783,on time even on sunday. fred was a great help with a late afternoon repair on a raining day. i will definitely be calling him again. thanks
1784,this business saved my vacation. i needed to get a chip replaced and have been looking for places for a week. finally recieved a response for same day repair with reasonable pricing.
1785,"we had a piece of our 'leaf free' gutters in dis-repair as that section is under a huge tree that was constantly bombarded by branches. we ran into a national competitor of mike's at a festival in town and asked for a quote. they came over, assed the damage and after seeing our reluctance at the price offered 3 'special discounts.' with that experience we contacted mike's. mike came over and without the details of the previous estimate described the repair that offered more than the previous estimate and at 15% less (no special 'fake' discounts needed!). the work was done and looks good!"
1786,i took my dyson vacuum for repair here and they fixed it in a few minutes and didn't charge much.  moe the owner is so friendly and helpful. whenever i need a new vacuum i will come here to purchase it.
1787,"fredy drove across town on one day's notice to perform a minor stucco repair on the corner of our 3rd garage entrance as well as touch up a small spot on our drywall behind our washer.  very responsive and very affordable!  he did a great job, and i would most highly recommend a-z stucco drywall for any of your stucco or drywall needs, big or small."
1788,"honesty, integrity and free flat repairs! need i say more!?

apparently i do, or yelp won't post this as a review"
1789,"had don come out for a second opinion on my a.c.. cause i felt the guys my home warranty sent out were trying to rip me off. he came out saturday morning, spent about an hour doing tests for a leak and diagnosing what this other company couldn't do and tell me on site when they came out friday. don found the issue and repaired it within an hour. now we have a cold house again and didn't have to wait til monday or tuesday. great company and will recommend to anybody."
1790,they fixed my singer when another place told me to throw it away. but i love it so i spent the money and they fixed it. there was a couple more problems after the repair but they stood behind it. i would recommend  larry and raymond
1791,"tom is punctual, pleasant and has repaired our stuck latch. job is well done !!!"
1792,"we had a very good experience with glendale roofing. we had a couple of leaks that had previously been repaired but did not hold. jd and his team came out, prescribed a permanent fix and were able to schedule us within a week. the workers were on site working exactly when they had promised and the work was completed in 2 days. the crew went to great lengths to insure the worksite was clean on completion. i didn't have to do any clean-up. i'd recommend glendale roofing for any size job for their high quality work and integrity."
1793,"we need cabinets and countertops for a kitchen renovation, and david was excellent at working with us around our busy schedules to be available for everything. the communication was top-notch and the kitchen looks great--we are very happy with the results."
1794,"just had my garage door repaired by patrick. he was top-notch. personable, professional and explained everything to me. here's to hoping i don't have more garage issues - but if i do, he made me a returning customer! highly recommend"
1795,"i recently bought a new a/c unit from veteran a/c and all i can say is justin and his team are a pleasure to work with, and their professionalism is like none other. justin (the owner) is extremely humble and honest, he strives to provide you with the knowledge you need to make an informed decision and provides competitive rates without sacrificing quality! what was most refreshing is how he won't try to oversell or push anything that is unnecessary. justin and his team will work with you to find what will best suit your specific situation. if you ever need a new unit or are just looking to call for a repair or maintenance i highly recommend you go with veteran air conditioning! 

thanks again justin and team for all the hard work and always being readily available!"
1796,"fast, friendly and fairly priced jewelry repair and sales. repeat customer who always leaves happy."
1797,"i am a first time home builder and joe came recommended to me by my realtor.  it has been a great experience working with him.  he is punctual, thorough and does an outstanding job of explaining issues in layman terms.  he reports are very detailed and in terms of his write up as well as supporting photography.  his inspections and reports have made the process of building much easier as it has helped me work with the builder in terms of arranging repairs before small problems became big issues.   joe and alpha & omega home inspections is highly recommended."
1798,ed was amazing. i messaged on the thursday evening. he came around friday morning as planned. quickly repaired the tiles taking photos of the before and after. passed the roof inspection for the sale of my house. thank you!
1799,"scott and his crew are very professional and we're beyond reasonable in their quote! after finding out about a personal hardship incurred by my family scott offered to go one step further and did our repair for free! he is a wonderful person with a heart as big as his smile! thank you scott and the team at arizona valley roofing, you guys are honest, amazing and just plain awesome!"
1800,"ivan and randy came in today to repair our ac upstairs, and they both did an excellent job on it! if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have gotten any air upstairs and start to melt from the heat  thank you guys so much! you guys were fast and reliable, and explained the situation and helped me understand what the problem was."
1801,"my a/c tripped the main breaker a few weeks ago, so i replaced it. yet, yesterday, the new breaker was tripped when i got home after work. i called my a/c repair man, but he was booked. he told me what he suspected, so i went to the discount a/c outlet to get a new capacitor. i assumed that the associate, eddie, was the owner due to his impeccable knowledge, explanations and super kind demeanor! i was shocked that he wasn't the owner, but the owner is blessed to have eddie on the counter! eddie explained to me that my system required 2 capacitors, 1 for the compressor and 1 for the fan. he gave me tips on installing the 2 new parts, including safety tips. due to eddie, my system is working perfectly! also, their pricing is extremely fair/reasonable and all parts have a 1 year warranty. in summary, i was very impressed with the business and, moreover, i was elated with eddie's impeccable knowledge, teaching skills and super kind, pleasant demeanor!"
1802,good company ran by good people.  tim is awesome.  he repaired our broken sliding door taking the time to ensure it done correctly.  most places would have said told us to replace the whole frame costing thousands rather than taking the time to see if a full repair could be done.  good communication through the whole process and he arrived on time with a great attitude.  highly recommended.
1803,"phil is an exceptional luthier. i have had two guitars set up by phil a taylor and a gibson. both were turned around quickly, under 72 hours and at a very reasonable price. they both play fantastic after phil applied his years of experience to my guitars.
if you need a repair or a set up check out junction guitars, phil is my go to guy from now on."
1804,"i've had two repairs completed in the last month, delivered on time and at very reasonable cost. great communications as well!

i am a technology consultant and i recommend rapifix to my clients for all their technology repair needs."
1805,"if you are looking for a realtor that will help you get the most out of selling your home, without having to do to much, look no further. david is awesome and he helped me out with all aspects of selling my house. while under contract several repairs were needed to close the deal and david had all the contacts needed to get the work complete so we could close the deal and i didn't have to do anything!! you won't be disappointed!!"
1806,"shout out to tim and paramount glass & mirror for another job well done! we had a window in the side yard that had a large crack (see photo). i was hoping to get the window fixed before the weather started to heat up and possibly have that glass break more than the large crack it already had.  i called him on thursday and he came out later that day to measure the window. by monday, the glass window is totally fixed and matches the other glass windows in the room nicely. tim had fixed another window in our house a couple years ago (see previous review) and i knew we could count on him to fix it quickly and reliably.  he  is knowledgeable about glass (he pointed out the different types of glass (different grades of low e) we had on some of our windows-which i never noticed until he pointed it out!), reliable, friendly and efficient.  this time, tim went above and beyond what was needed!  on the way in, he noticed one of the side metal frames was missing from my front window near the entrance.  after fixing the cracked window, he asked if he could fix that aesthetic part of the front window for free since it was in the front of the house and was one of the first windows visitors would see of our house (did i mention for free?!)!  i love handymen that are honest, perfectionist and take pride in doing their best job!  thank you tim and paramount glass & mirror for a job well done!"
1807,i called and they came out right away.  they had everything to fix the problem with them.  i like the way they email a picture of the repair man before they get to your house.  will use a1 garage doors again!
1808,i saw the poor reviews and i was shocked.  i was also assigned all star by my home warranty company and i had an excellent experience with joe!  this was after two prior contractors did repairs on my a/c system. i had given up hope on getting a good contractor from first american home warranty until joe was assigned to fix my a/c.  i think he's great!
1809,"made an appointment at 7am and had my dryer repaired that day.

communicated his whereabouts so i wasn't held hostage in a ""four hour window"".

reasonable rates.  expert repair.  saved me a ton!

wouldn't hesitate to hire again."
1810,"bob is one of the greatest handyman around! he helped me to solve my problem and saved me money too. it is to hard to find a honest down to earth trusty person, but bob was all of that. i truly felt like i was talking with one of my buddies. thank you so much and keep being you. i would recommend him to everyone (give him a call his worth it)!"
1811,"yup! ~ as good as it gets.  these guys don't just show up and throw paint on your house while  simultaneously leaving trash in your yard.  not at all!!  i called and a few days later, received a more than fair quote.  a week later the house was power-washed and about a week after that (remember we're in the midst of our ""winder"" here in vegas) my house was taped off and painted.  then everything that had been pulled away from the house, landscaping rock, patio furniture, garden gnomes and flamingos were all replaced and the job was done the same day!!  oh! did i mention they also repair broken stucco and of course scrape old peeling paint.  should be a no-brainer that last one, but not all painting contractors properly prep.  thank you mcmillan & mcmillan."
1812,"now that is off season for summer take advantage of the 49.00 tune up.  just had mine done today.  we also just purchased a condo for my mom and the inspector from our realtor's referral  was not allowed on the roof as an inspector to check the unit, so we hired dukes of air and it needed a $300 repair that the seller will have to fix."
1813,"i will absolutely be returning to make a purchase.. i was a huge pain as i am very new to playing guitar and had so many questions. the sales guys were busy so i asked mason in repairs to assist me. he went above and beyond to inform me of the best fit for me and helped me way more than his job required. i really appreciated his passion and knowledge of guitars too! i didn't end up buying a guitar yet, but when i am ready i will definitely go to that location for my purchase. thanks, mason!"
1814,will is great! responded to my plea for help same day and had the frig repair done in short order.  highly recommend!
1815,"one word ""amazing"" kent is professional and on time. i will definitely be contacting him to do further work on my home. it is hard to find a reliable handyman but kent got the job done."
1816,"cane here to get my galaxy note 4 repaired and they did in a relative quickly manner. had a 24hr turn around because they didnt have the part on hand, however they stuck to their deadline."
1817,"i called plumbing experts strictly based on the reviews i saw here on yelp.

the 5 star reviews couldn't have been more true. aaron showed up on time, was very professional and had my faucet working in no time.

he saved me over $300 and his repairs only took a few minutes.

i can't thank him and his company enough for its fantastic work. without a doubt i recommend plumbing experts for your needs!

5 star guys!"
1818,very fast and pinpoint to the problems. owner is honest and told me all repair procedures.
1819,kristen their head of maintenance did a great job responding to my oven repair. her team was able to find the part and schedule a repair in 48 hours. i love to bake and i use my oven a lot so the quick turnaround time made a big difference to me and my family.
1820,"on time, professional, and explained everything.  my dishwasher wouldn't drain.  was quoted a low price and that is exactly what was due by the end.. love that, no surprises!  will use him for any handyman needs and refer him 100% :)"
1821,"chris was awesome, last two months my water bill went up $15 a month and i didn't realize my drip system had a leak in it...called him, diagnosed and repaired in 30 minutes...replaced my emitters and ran a patch bypass in the ground that was tangled in a bunch of roots.  not only that i called at like 8am on a saturday and he was over by 3!  rate is awesome, was super worried it would cost a ton...and i have a very small drip system and no grass, just a few bushes in one zone..it did not cost a ton...i will tell all my co-workers about him...best in vegas as far as i'm concerned."
1822,"this company is really good about helping you to use your warranties to the full extent.  we had them come out to fix a pump that was just out of warranty, and they told us to try anyway, and the company decided to honor the warranty even though it was not technically their responsibility.  had r&r not told us to do that, we would have spent $1,400 on the repair.  highly recommend them!"
1823,"this place should be on the 'you've got to eat here"" show.  it's a little hidden gem!  milkshakes and burgers are very impressive.  high five to their renovations."
1824,came here late in the day so there wasn't much left. this is very much the old school bakery and delicatessen. there was limited seating on my visit due to ongoing renovation. my guess is they could add a whole new floor of seating and it would still be busy all the time. it seems to operate both as a local hangout and a destination for all those goodies. the desserts were fantastic and a good coffee. tre mari is on my list of go-to for dessert!
1825,"i've gone here time & again when i lived on the west side of town, so it holds four stars in my heart. it's huge, with a path for running, the place where kids can hangout to skateboard in the skate park, a designated playground, basketball court, & soccer field located on the opposite side of the park. the soccer field is huge, as well as the park itself. i've enjoyed this park for the sake i always used to come when extreme thing or outdoor events were happening at desert breeze. even with large events, i've never had a problem with finding parking (even if it was in the dirt lot).

the dog park can use a little renovation nowadays, but it always used to be the place to go to see & meet dogs with their owners from the west side of town."
1826,"ilya did a great job fixing my leaky washer.  one trip to diagnose, and one to perform the repair once the parts came in."
1827,5 stars for sure. i called them based on the reviews on yelp. the owner came out and was very professional and knowledgeable.  this will be my go-to company for any repairs needed in the future.  a friend asked for an a/c repair company a few days later and guess who i suggested!
1828,in less than 24 hours they had my garbage disposal fixed. showed up exactly when they said they would and although i missed the gentleman's name who did the repair he was thorough and explained everything without making me feel like i was being talked down to. he even made sure i had other numbers in case i had any additional issues with water damage. a++++++ these guys are the best!
1829,we recently moved and our furniture took a bit of a beating. i was upset and in desperation called las vegas furniture repair after reading the reviews in yelp. victor did an outstanding job fixing these pieces. we even called him again to touch up the finish on a dining room table. i would definitely recommend!!!
1830,"recently, we needed some repair work done on the exit door in our garage. we called four contractors to get bids; don responded first and scheduled an appointment the next day. he came on time and submitted a written estimate that same day. the work was completed in a timely way, and at exactly the price estimated. work was outstanding in quality. we would use them again."
1831,my son is in the rainbow youth soccer league here at desert breeze park. i love the league because they only play here. the fields are divided by color and the new fence makes it feel safer as far as balls rolling into streets.  the playground could use some renovation but the soccer fields are excellent!
1832,"our upstairs thermostat went berserk and wouldn't stop spitting out heat.  when the bedroom reached 83° and i was close to passing out, we turned it off and bought a new one the next day.  our handyman installed it, but that didn't seem to fix the problem, so we called airria, a company we used a couple of years ago on the recommendation of a neighbor.

they came only about 15 minutes after our call and went right to work to diagnose the issue.  i've had several experiences in the past with other companies, here and in new jersey, who i called on an emergency basis, only to be ripped off badly.  not this company.  once again they impressed us with their honesty.  they could have told us we needed a new and better thermostat.  or even a new furnace.  they thought the problem might be with the circuit board, but said that they didn't want to install it until they were sure, because now the replaced thermostat seemed to be working.  they cleaned out the system and added two small parts, told us to monitor the thermostat over the weekend, and charged a reasonable amount. 

most homeowner have no idea what's going on when there is a problem with their heating and air conditioning and are at the mercy of too many dishonest hvac companies. there is no question that we will continue to use airria for all our future hvac needs.  they are prompt, reliable, and honest."
1833,just had in house grandfather clock repair done by bob...excellent work.  he was on time..called ahead..cleaned clock and adjusted timing.  so glad my 30 year old clock working again.  and bob even called in the evening to check that clock ok !!!
1834,"i have had these guys out twice. once for a water heater, and again for replacement of a couple of shut off valves under the sink. both times they arrived the same day and made the repair every quickly. very courteous and efficient!"
1835,"my wife and i are delighted with the work done by handyman matters in our condo in old town scottsdale! michele bonner is a fine, efficient, well organized, friendly representative of the company, and she assigned steve to take on some fairly complex projects that an earlier handyman was afraid to tackle. 

over a period of about three months, we had steve here on three visits to fix a number of things we wanted done. the most complex was to remove an underpowered and improperly ducted bathroom exhaust fan. what made the job complex is that some remodelers three years ago boxed in the old exhaust fan when they installed brazilian ipe wood on the bathroom ceiling. the wood is very hard to work, and steve dove into the repair without hesitation. he has a seemingly sixth sense about how to do things, and he's an outstanding problem solver. he installed the proper sized new fan that we bought from amazon. 

on his second visit, steve re-routed and installed new, larger duct work for the new fan, which then much more effectively removed excess moisture. on his recent third visit, steve leveled the ipe wood ceiling in the bathroom, installed two new sink drain assemblies, a new closet shelf, and added a vertical partition in a custom-made closet. he also repaired some tile grout and other miscellaneous small jobs while he was here. 

based on these positive experiences, we highly recommend handyman matters of scottsdale. they're not the least expensive, but they are the best we have found over many years of having home repairs made in various places we've lived. 

we happily give them our highest rating!"
1836,"just got my suv repaired by these guys. they did great work. hopefully i won't have to use them again but i definitely would if i needed to. good pricing, fast repair and really accommodating."
1837,they have helped repair my pump a couple different times. very easy to work with on scheduling and billing.
1838,"look no further. i was searching and found dave. dave is the only person i will ever call for sprinkler help with my properties. he was prompt, courteous, fair. he resolved issues and caught potential future issues. extremely happy with dave's sprinkler repair."
1839,"dan cifelli arrived right on time this morning to repair a leak in my kitchen drain.  he took the time to explain the excavation that needed to be done to reach the drain pipe in the wall, and when finished later in the day, explained what he did to fix the problem plus further work that might be needed.  as another recent reviewer stated, he was very personable and knowledgeable, and i had no hesitation in trusting him to rip open a hole in the kitchen wall to fix the leak.  i will definitely use a-accent again and will happily recommend them to others!"
1840,"bought a side by side refrigerator last june. there were some problems and they made three trips to make the repairs. i had another problem three months later and didn't charge me even though it was out of warranty. i've needed one repair since, they came out right away and the charge was fair. they are professional and courteous and i will be purchasing from them again."
1841,"tadoussac c'est un peu un repaire à touristes... alors quand il s'agit de trouver un endroit où se régaler on se méfie....! le café bohème nous l'avons trouvé par hasard au bout de la rue de notre hôtel et grâce aux bons avis yelp nous avons décidé de pousser la porte...
gros coup de coeur pour les nachos qui ont su nous rassasier après une longue journée passée sur le fjord à la découverte des magnifiques paysages de la région."
1842,beer system has still not been updated. the beer is still warm. their long draw system either needs more polyethylene glycol or its simply broken and need repair.
1843,"robert tu just left our office. he was amazing! he knew what to do, did it quickly and was very fair on the pricing. robert was personable and so helpful, we will definitely call the dukes of air every time we need cooling and heating repairs. thanks guys!!"
1844,"we closed on our new house and needed to move in right away. michael and his crew were awesome! they showed up ready to work. they repaired the drywall holes, closed up a doggy door and painted the baseboards and walls. they were a little higher priced than the other guys, but we are glad we chose them."
1845,"my handyman tried to fix my leaky tub and we ended up with a broken pipe, had to turn off the water and it was 3pm.  i called george brazil, at first it was going to be 9pm before they could get someone out, but then they called and said wade could make it at 7pm.  they sent me an email with wades picture so i knew who was coming. what a great guy, he did a great job and even did a non emergent change on my other bathroom faucets.  which he really didn't gave to do, but did it with a smile on his face.  wont hesitate to call george brazil if needed in the future and will recommend them to all my neighbors who have the same old plumbing i have.  thanks for saving us from a night with no bathroom!!"
1846,2 and a half years later i am still so ecstatic about this place and all the renovations. this business has definitely grown and changed so much for the better. the owners and their gorgeous baby son are so genuine and such kind people who make you feel at home and accept so much diversity. i have never seen an angry or unhappy customer here and the quality is 900% love you guys!!
1847,"completely agree with all the great reviews about apex repair and its owner song. we had a clogged dishwasher drain, with sitting water at the bottom. song came out promptly and managed to pull gunk, broken glass and part of a chop stick out of the drain! he could easily have taken us for a full motor replacement (how would i have known?), but he just got all this stuff out of the drain and charged a reasonable $95. he was also a gentleman and very professional. a pleasure to work with. i highly recommend apex."
1848,leo is the best guy for stucco repair. i highly recommend him. dont look any further.
1849,"had a cap break and start leaking 7:30pm on a sunday, called pure & they had 2 guys out by 8:30.  both guys were professional and very quick to diagnose and give an estimate.   they repaired the leak and cap in addition to clear out a clog 3 other plumbers couldn't find!   all within and hour!!!  all is fixed & definitely would refer them!!  & use again if necessary.  thank you pure"
1850,ams is pricey and i am not rich and i do not have a fancy yard.  however they are reliable and emails are answered promptly. my handyman said the ams crew was friendly and polite toward him. those things are important to me.
1851,"i am so impressed by the professionalism of the staff.  they've been well trained to combine efficiency with friendly effectiveness.  i had a problem with an item, and it was repaired within 24 hours.  very impressive!"
1852,"i totally recommend drew for all a/c repair and maintenance! he is honest and really treats his clients with respect. if you want someone reliable and honest to work with then you should call drew air.he will even go out of his way to check if your parts are still under warranty! here in arizona ac units break often,its nice to have someone to call on wkends and holidays when you nneed help with you ac!"
1853,"these guys are great! always willing to answer questions, they don't try to up-sell repairs you don't need, and they are incredibly professional and a joy to deal with. highly recommend them!"
1854,"just got my leather boots repaired here. there was a rip in the leather on the toe, and he said that although he couldn't completely fix it, he could make it look much better. he originally told me it would take about a week, but called me 2 days later to tell me they were done! he managed to match the color perfectly, and you can only tell they were fixed if you look very closely. it was also very affordable - i only spent $14 on the repair!"
1855,"highly recommend speedy furniture repair.  they just refinished my kitchen cabinets and they are like new (see photo 13-15).  friendly family business. clean..showed up on time, attention to detail, amazing work. love my new cabinets."
1856,"i like the renovations, much brighter! always find it clean when eating in. and that sauce!"
1857,"amazing work! i had to take some time off work to meet mark at my home for some drain repairs. not only did he confirm our appointment the morning of, he also called me an hour before the appointment to tell me he was on the way. after all this, he was right on time. that helps a million because i work hourly and need all the hours i can get. 

while here, he talked with me about the issues and let me explain my concerns and goals for the plumbing. he fixed the drains quickly and then pointed out another issue and gave me option to fix it. 

mark gave me all the pricing before he got working and even got a quote for me for a future tankless water heater! no surprises and a very kind person to have in your home while fixing the problems plumbing presents."

1859,great roofers! easy to work with and very professional. did a great repair on my roof. would highly recommend!
1860,"had some issues with some repairs made by their technicians on warranty repairs. the owner stepped up to the plate, contacted me via email and after some research, refunded me the difference of the cost of those repairs. i would do business with this company again because they stand behind their work."
1861,"i had a slow leak coming from my kitchen sink. scheduling was super convenient, they were able to easily accommodate my hectic schedule. i think my technicians name was joe, but not positive. anyway, he was very helpful. explained exactly what was going on and gave me several repair options to fit my budget. he repaired the initial leak and also replaced the faucet. it definitely took longer than expected. other than that i was completely satisfied and will definitely call pure plumbing the next time i need a plumber!"
1862,i am usually not the one to leave reviews. we took our 2008 honda to few places and were told something is wrong with out compressor. we postponed the repair for few months thinking it's going to cost us big money. adams fixed it for less than 150. he is awesome.
1863,amazing experience! very professional! i called and was able to get an appointment first thing the next day. i knew when to expect their arrival and knew exactly what had to be repaired once they listened to my compliant and inspected our system. they were fast and did an exceptional job! highly recommended for anyone needing help with their garage door!

1866,"we are buying a remodeled condo, thinking we may wave the inspection, i insisted we get it, spouse said  condo looks good. jonathon found several items that we did not find, so glad we spent the $350 (i think) to get it done. the seller agreed to fix repair all the things noted. so it actually was more than in repairs than the inspection was. although i was not there for the inspection, my realtor was there.  and all went off without a hitch. i would use them for my next home purchase and i recommend jonathon at advantage inspections."
1867,"i brought a broken gold-plated chain necklace in for repair. they told me the cost for repair up front. less than an hour, it was fixed!"
1868,they take real pride in their work and followed up with us at no additional charge.  we had to have our hot water heater replaced which was a very big project because our home is heated using the same water heater as the one that heats the water for our home. it is very important to us that the repair people we hire know what they are doing and that we can trust who does the work needed to keep our home running.  we highly recommend adaven plumbing!!!
1869,"jake was very professional & got the job done. if i use hawthorne again, i'd make a specific request for jake! thanks jake! ;)

repairs made: disposal replacement and fixed connected pipes. $386 for the part, labor, and 2yr warranty. i forgot to ask for the military discount.

1874,"i tried another garage door company first. they could not come through. so i called a1 garage door. they sent one of their repair specialists, elgin, to affect the repairs. he arrived in a timely manner, assessed the parts which needed replacing, offered suggestions and options and left to pick up the necessary repair items. within short order he returned and replaced the worn out garage door motor and attachments. now for the icing on the cake.
elgin's personality. i sat in the garage and talked with him the whole time he was working. he's truly an asset to his company. when he finished making the repairs, i was glad to have made his acquaintance. he is representing his company and i feel he accomplished that in the most professional manner. i highly recommend a1 garage door. thanks a1."
1875,"for someone like myself that hates having anything repainted or repaired , ""since i am afraid it will never look like it did when it was new"" , i was extremely impressed that i couldn't even tell that it was damaged prior , looked like new again, thank you new look you made this process painless."

1882,raul is the man!  short term notice and he was out the next day to repair our garage door.  instead of trying to upsell us he repaired what was broken or a fair price and  reprogrammed our clickers. highly recommend this company to everyone.
1883,anyone can build a nice building. it's the people that make it special. your repair staff and office staff are some of the most friendly and responsive i've ever experienced. the building is also clean and manicured to perfection. what's not to like?
1884,"i give jt two five stars, first for integrity & second for outstanding workmanship. he's done many projects but the most impressive was the gigantic pot rack installed with an 18' ceiling. absolutely level the first time!  how many handymen would even attempt that job!  
another great job was installation of ground lighting and i could go on...
jude"

1887,"inspector paul is a real pro.  he has done three home inspections for me and my family members.  in each case, he found many things that a less-knowledgeable inspector would likely have missed.  paul has saved me many headaches and thousands of dollars on each purchase.  his reports are very detailed and thorough and the video's and photo's he provides makes it easy to see that what he is saying is true.  this makes negotiating with sellers for repairs very straightforward.  he has always been prompt for his inspections and timely with his reports.  i highly recommend inspector paul and would not consider buying a home without his input."
1888,ilya was able to repair my washer on the same day i called him.  he was very professional and was able to diagnose and explain what was wrong with my washer.  would not hesitate to call him for any other repairs.
1889,"i can't even start to describe how great penguin air was to us. our ac went out in the 100+ degree heat and we needed it repaired or replaced quickly. first, we talked to will and he was very helpful and honest, showing us all the different units, including pricing and financing. 

next, the ac installers arrived at our house very quickly and we're very professional. they did the job in a short period of time. and now we are cool again!  

we were super impressed and recommend penguin to anyone who wants fast and honest work done."
1890,had new garbage disposal put in under ahs warranty. the repair guy- jason i think- was quick and friendly! i see others haven't had the same experience but we really liked this company.
1891,"we have been using cruz for everything for more than 9 years. he installed all of the new air conditioners in two houses we bought, and maintained and repaired the units in our current house. he always explains the costs, and never pushes a more expensive repair. he is prompt, courteous, and very personable. we would never consider using anyone but cruz."
1892,i've used on a couple of occasions so far too repair a leak in my a/c system and replace valve cover gaskets on my 2001 dodge ram 1500 4x4.  they've been very competent and intent on quality workmanship.
1893,"this has been one of the best experiences ever. no one wants to spend money to repair their air-conditioner not to mention unexpectedly. penguin air went above and beyond all of my expectations. they were fast, efficient and friendly. thanks for keeping me and my family cool...we appreciate everything."
1894,"outstanding!!! bob and jim were total professionals. they arrived on time, and ensured that my install was a clean and great looking. not only does he do dog door installation, but we talked about other projects around the house. as for the door, it was brand new and opened right in front of me. hands down a true handyman that you can trust coming into your house!"
1895,contacted them from their website when my washer wouldn't drain. they were actually cheaper and faster then the home warranty company repair technician. fixed the unit and tested it before left. called a week later to follow up and make sure it was working ok. website bookmarked for future use
1896,"great work and very knowledgable. super nice, always smiles and excellent to work with. 
unlike many handymen, he is prompt and works on a great time line.  i would recommend him time and time again as we have seen his work more then a few times now and it is always prideful and excellent."
1897,this place is a landmark in the city. i've seen this club go through multiple changes. the recent renovation really open up the club. one reason i like going here is the fact that the club is not a long hallway like the two others on yonge st.
1898,"jesse was early, professional and went beyond what most repairmen do when trying to pinpoint the source of the problem.  i've used penguin a hanful of times now and have been very happy with them (not many companies impress me these days).  i will use penguin in the future."
1899,went for repair of my air conditioning under warranty and also to have a seat bottom reupholstered resulting from a mishap that caused some deformation of the 'leather'.  heather was helpful and very timely with her communication and promises.  air conditioning works and the seat is perfect.  work completed sooner than promised.  thanks.

would recommend."
1902,ryan did an excellent job. explained everything thoroughly and did a fabulous job. i highly recommend a1 repair. thanks ryan for being such a helpful repairman.
1903,"came to yelp, and read the reviews. they came to give free estimate very quickly. and, like all the reviews said, they were outstanding!  less expensive than the other estimate that i received, and they did the job while on site. very professional, and the the result of their repairs is terrific!"
1904,"i made an appointment with tonya to have my a/c repaired with arizona dukes of air because the fan wasn't turning on my unit. made the appointment for monday at 7am. robert called me and told me he would be by at 7:15. at 7:15, the orange van pulled up and i showed robert where the unit was and told him the problem. in a couple of minutes he told me that my capacitor was bad. he installed a new dual capacitor which will help minimize any further problems. and it was less than i expected to pay. took him less than 45 minutes from when he arrived to when he left and most of that time was gabbing about living in orange county. (he's originally from there like i am) robert was a cool guy and if you need your a/c worked on, give arizona dukes of air a call."
1905,the best!!  emergency baseball glove repair between tourney games.   no one else could be bothered with such a trivial repair - but cecil respects his customers.
1906,"i have used phil's several times for my rental properties and they are normally responsive and have a can do attitude with small and larger jobs.  i typically email them a list with photos and they provide their ""guestimates"" which are estimated charges - very helpful so i can get an idea of the costs before they mobilize.  when the repair or issue hasn't been within their wheelhouse, they have referred me to a company who is reputable and competent - that is a huge benefit.  i would highly recommend them."
1907,"i had the best experience with this company and shane, the technician that came out to the house.  i had done some research on the issue i was having with my garage.  once shane completed the safety inspection he was patient to explain the repair need and within a hour i had a new system in place and i was thrilled that it was done so well.  shane was patient, knowledgeable and friendly, thank you a1."
1908,"josiah is the best! his diagnostic skills are unmatched. we use him for routine maint. and repair, and have always been satisfied with his work. he's very friendly and takes the time to explain his diagnosis. we will continue to use him and recommend him to our friends."

1910,"awesome company! friendly reception when i called this morning to request ac repair. when the receptionist told me someone could come this afternoon, i requested a call a little bit ahead of time so that i could kennel dogs. the repairman called me less than a hour later and said he could be there in 30 minutes, if that was alright.

he showed up exactly on time, was very professional, and did not try and sell me anything i did not need. he replaced the broken part in less than an hour for an amazingly good price. i had called them originally based on the recommendation of a friend, combined with their yelp reviews, and am very happy i did so!"
1911,"marcus was great to work with. we've had dmc roofing out two separate times now, once to repair our roof and the other to replace our porch. both times have been great! work happened on time and completed as scheduled. we would definitely call on them again. thanks guys!"

1913,the gravel trails are well-groomed at easy to walk. some of the signs are in need of repair. they are dog-friendly. the map distribution boxes are all empty. the admission price ($6) is a little steep. the playground is awesome!!!
1914,"absolutely amazing! long story long after weeks of meeting with plumbers, licensed and unlicensed i contacted jerry. 
believe me in a few short weeks i've seen it all (job was such that it needed a quote/plumber to see the situation before taking it on). i've had people a few hours late to no shows, plumbers on crack or whatever else drugs they may do, to others saying it can't be done or they wouldn't want to do it, quotes from $400 to $1500, hours to complete from 2 to 2 days. to make things more difficult it was a condo building, so water has to be turned off to multiple units. 
these guys are fantastic (israel was the plumber assigned to my job), on time, super professional and friendly (no smelly, exposed crack plumbers here), work completed in half the time they estimated and the work area left so tidy i had nothing to clean. did i mention that their price was on the low end?! 
great repairmen are hard to find and cobra plumbing is it! highly impressed! thank you."
1915,this theater is a story of redemption. what was arguably one of the worst theaters on cleveland's west side has become the favorite of my wife and i. thank you amc for the fantastic renovation!
1916,"i was extremely satisfied with my experience.

i had a leak in the main line between the meter at the curb and where the copper line that enters the house.  

gabe came out gave me an estimate and started work immediately.  it's late august, so it was blazing hot.  he arrived exactly on time - to the minute, was very friendly, documented the issue with the broken pvc pipe with pictures, before the repair, and after.  these were included with a copy of my invoice which was sent by email.

the repair itself looked great (but i'm obviously not a plumber) and i again have running water.  gabe also cleaned up everything and it looked like he was never there when he finished.  

thanks gabe!"
1917,"this is the nearest starbucks from my house. staff is always friendly, quick and get my order right each time.

love the new renovations.

why not 5 stars? i can't give any starbucks 5 stars until they cut their ties with monsanto."
1918,"best word to describe these guys is, professional. called them just a few hours after i found out my ac unit had stopped working. they were able to show up earlier than expected and called to let me know. once they assessed the issue they took the time to explain what needed to be done and made sure only necessary repairs were made as i'm currently paying off some plumbing work. they even fixed a part of my fencing that had fallen down next to the ac unit!!! i won't be dealing with anyone else for my ac and heating needs and am super impressed this company!"
1919,we love aiko and we especially love our home! we have had zero issues and any time we email about something needing repair they immediately send someone one out. the fees are a little higher than others but if you stay within your agreement you have nothing to worry about.
1920,love this place!!!  they always do an amazing job with my zowee!  making an appointment is easy and they are very accommodating.  my dog loves this place as much as i do.  price is great.  they just did a fabulous renovation and the place looks awesome!!!
1921,"ok, got the panels up over the weekend. the crew was great,  explained everything to me, where the pipes go and everything up to code. only 1 problem. i'm missing roof tiles over my garage. the garage is lower then the roof they put the panels on, so if your not directly on the garage you can't see the garage roof. this was just an oversight. i understand things happen. i am glad it is not raining for the next few days.i know it will be fixed, fast.

 update! big hole in roof, maybe more i can only see the top of my garage. it's been 4 days of calling and now the rain is coming. i don't want water damage of any kind. i have been told that today, someone will come out and cover the hole's with plastic. fine by me, but the aggravation is not. if i do not have a covered roof by 8pm i will contact the nevada contractors board and get someone to cover my roof in plastic sheets and sue solar city for the cost.

update: got my roof fixed before the rain, i had to make a complaint with the nevada contractors board to get it done but it's done. it's nice to have friends in high places.
i had to use the ncb once before and they don't mess around.
this is what i found out about the installation of solar panels. solarcity has 57 crews in vegas everyday putting panels up. they only have 3 men, 1 crew to do the repair of all the homes. solarcity really needs to get a few more crews to finish the construction.
but what do i know? my roof is fixed and it's raining. now let's see what my power bill will be in a few months."
1922,"kristina is the absolute best! she always goes out of her way to make sure i'm happy! this week she came through with my dream bag!!!! a bag i thought for sure i'd have to waitlist for since online it always says ""call for availability"". i mentioned last week that i wanted it and magically she had it on saturday, i don't know if that's fate or what but i'm not questioning it. i can't thank her enough! from purchases, to repairs, to custom orders kristina k. is the best!!!"
1923,litterally just left.  brad was quick and honest and was able to repair my main board on my refrigerator.  will use e&j again for sure.
1924,a little bit of renovation going on and things have been moved around but still a huge supply of goods.
1925,"i decided to fix up a few coach bags that had been in heavy rotation for awhile, so i took them in, and asked what could be done to make them look refreshed.  the owner told me that he could clean them, repair one of the straps on my black bag, and dye a light colored bag that had marks and wear on both sides.  i agreed, and we settled on a fee of $160, cash. i expected them to look better, but wasn't expecting a miracle.  well, i got one!  all four of the bags were cleaned inside and out, to look as good as when they were brand new. the strap was repaired on the black bag, and most surprising of all, the battered and stained buff colored bag was now a beautiful, shiny, rich brown!  i can't wait to wear it this fall!!  all for less than the cost of a new coach bag. very impressive."
1926,fresh coat just repaired the drywall in my master bath and basically replaced half of it due to a remodel.    the job is perfect.  they did an amazing job of making the walls smooth and you cannot even tell where the repairs were made.  highly recommend.  they also repaired some stucco on the outside of my home.  great job there too!
1927,great staff. knowledgeable across bicycle brands.  i take my trek for repairs.  quick and reasonable.  very convenient location near the greenway
1928,one of my favorite place to spend my saturday. the knowledgeable staff is there to assist you with and questions you might have regarding you airsoft guns and ways in which you can up grade your weapons. if you happen to have a problem with you weapon they have a tech room with staff trained in airsoft weapon repair. the over night lock-ins are awesome!!!
1929,"kent has been helping me with several properties for several years now... whenever i contact him, he returns my calls or email in a prompt fashion. he is professional, speedy, and very detail oriented (as his business name suggests). i have had him do drywall repair, fit custom doors, and other small projects. i would highly recommend kent... he's awesome!"
1930,"kitchen was remodeled. kitchen is beautiful, but a very small piece of molding needs replaced. there is a hole where it meets the cabinet. called a few times, they said on the list, but never came to repair it. was told to call installer. sent text with picture, still never came to replace the molding."
1931,"been using them for a year on our bmws and mercedez and the work has always been excellent. paul and david are great! we trust their opinion. they don't recommend unnecessary repairs. they do a good job with maintenance and upkeep, not just repairs. they offer complimentary transportation uptown and to south park. just wish they took american express."
1932,"i have an older roland xp-10 keyboard that suffered from ""sticky keys"" syndrome, which i guess is common in warmer climates where the membrane within the key bed swells and the keys stick.  i dropped it off and they repaired it fast, cost was much cheaper than i expected, and now my roland is like a new keyboard.  highly recommended."
1933,"the best in the valley! i cannot say enough great things about this business. they are prompt and customer centered. they did a beautiful job on the repairs. most importantly, even though it ended up costing more than the original estimate, they honored their estimate. i am now a customer for life. i'm beyond impressed with this business!"
1934,i have been here for almost three years. i love the new renovations! a little disappointed with the continuous increase of rent.
1935,i recently made a rude comment about technician jake. he did make things right and turns out hes actually a very knowledgeable and responsible technician. the airtime office staff has always been very friendly and professional. and now i would definately recommend this company for repairs!
1936,"these guys are amazing. when i stopped by as a walk-in needing a road hazzard repair, they were already slammed. but, they worked me in anyway. i am very greatful. not only that but, they always seemed calm and in control even though the place was extremely busy, it was over 100 degrees outside and many of the other customers seemed to have attitude problems from the heat.

i would like to mention ""brett"" by name. he is a huge asset to the team."
1937,best handyman in town! very professional and dependable. i can honestly say i'll be calling him for all my home repairs.

1940,recently went here for a ipad 2 glass repair before i went on vacation. pricing was great and my ipad looks like new. super friendly staff!
1941,"when i need handyman work i will call james first. i had a unique problem that involved an area on my roof and he was quick to recognize the problem and solve it. i had called several businesses and pest control but james had the solution for a very reasonable price. prompt, courteous and professional."

1944,"we had a problem with our 25 year old shower.  rick candito plainly and thoroughly explained the problem and the array of options we had to either fix and/or replace our old fixture(s).  he repaired it such that it runs better than ever. he also installed a new kitchen faucet which required the unexpected need to disconnect, untangle, and then reconnect the myriad of tubes and hoses under the sink to ensure the pull-down mechanism would flow freely and easily.  we will call pure plumbing again for any future plumbing needs, and hope that rick will be the plumber assigned to our call."
1945,"you guys did it again! what an amazing job! over the last few years i brought my wheels to be fixed and each time, they look like brand new and i cannot even tell where the damage was. you will always be my go to repair place. thank you!!!"

1948,"thank you yelp, for another great find!!! i needed a cuckoo clock repaired for my mother that lives in tx. i bought it about 15years ago when i was stationed in germany. she searched near her and the closes location that would even look at it, was over two hundred miles away. i called these guys, asked if they work on these type of clocks, they said ""we sure do"". i took it to them and two weeks later (holidays and waiting on parts, delayed the process) the clock looks brand new again. thank you guys so so much!!!"
1949,i love lvac. the facilities are always clean and in good repair. the staff is amazing. this new facility was something i was waiting for.  really convenience location.

i would highly recommend this company for your roof repair needs!!"
1952,"the hose connection to our washer was leaking. we temporarily patched it with teflon tape but wanted a professional to look at it as we aren't very handy.

ernie came out (on time, same day) and let us know it was probably fine. we had him replace the hose and connection anyway just for piece of mind ... our hose was 5+ years old probably ... but there was no pressure to do so. always nice to have a repair guy that is honest and upfront about what is necessary.

great work, we'll happily use them again in the future."

1955,"being a home owner and not knowing the ends and outs of air conditioning, it can give you a little anxiety when someone is fixing your unit. my unit broke when it was 115 degrees out and hatch air saved the day. they were very upfront and honest and did a fabulous repair job. they responded promptly, were very clean and tidy when on the job, and left with a smile even though it was extremely hot in my attic. i highly recommend these guys!"
1956,"i've been going to lamanna's bakery since the beginning.  love the pizza! the smoked provolone with mushroom is probably the best pizza i ever had.  pastries and cakes are amazing.  it's nice that you could dine in now after the renovation.  

cannoli on point"
1957,"our first floor unit was blowing warm air, so after checking yelp and seeing all the positive reviews for dukes of air i gave them a call.  even after missing my appointment today, they quickly rescheduled and came out to repair.  everyone was extremely courteous and accommodating. dustin, the tech, explained the repair, showed me the bad capacitor, told me cost, and quickly repaired.  if i had a second set of hands, i would give them four thumbs up."
1958,when i purchased a used dell from foxetech alex was great to work with.  i give me several options and was able to find something that was able to work with my budget.  he as also been very helpful with repairs and upgrades.
1959,"brought three clubs there for repairs, owner was helpful and after a mix up with one of my repairs he even delivered the club to my house."
1960,"i didn't get my wheel repaired, but david fosburg came by and spoke to me about my wheel damage and what he could do for me. he was very informative and professional and i would 100% recommend this company based off my experience."
1961,"needed a tub faucet repaired or replaced and pop up drain stopper replaced.  called two other companies, never returned my call. was told about pure, went to yelp, excellent reviews. called, talked with hope, very professional, polite & informed.  they sent a tech out the next day, perfect, no hassle. i will use them again."
1962,pretty good overall. maybe a little touch ups around the place with paint and minor repairs are needed but it is still a nice location and the overnight desk lady was very polite and professional. i would stay again if i come through.
1963,"had some issues with some repairs made by their technicians on warranty repairs. the owner stepped up to the plate, contacted me via email and after some research, refunded me the difference of the cost of those repairs."
1964,"need a handyman in madison? yeah - i sure did. handyman is one thing i'm not. my wife said to try angie's list - so i did and tracked down jeff at ""jb's home improvements"" - i had a list of little projects to get get done and i had jeff drop in to give me an estimate - on replacing dimmer switches, hanging art up high in my hall, fixing a hole in my wall and a few other minor irritants. he and his helper john came right on time and did everything in about a hour that i would have taken six months to figureout and screw up -- and now i'll have a few more things for him. so i'm just passing along this sincere recommendation - he says ""specializing in the ""smaller projects"" -- and he does them well, quickly and at a very fair price. and he has a reall tall ladder i'd never climb! ph: (608) 217-7890"
1965,"as a life long steelers fan, i was looking forward to this tour. overall it was a good tour. it was a surprisingly large crowd. i think there ended  up being six groups with 20 or so in each. 
there are lots of historical items in the stadium and i thought it was very interesting. we got to go to the locker room, onto the field level, press box and suites. 
the tour lasted a little over an hour. there was a fair amount of renovation going on so that impacted the flow of the tour some. 
my only complaint is that the tour groups kept meeting up and crossing paths which caused delays and some confusion but i think that could have been sure to all the renovation work.
it was a good tour. i am glad i went."
1966,"great ac company to work with. our ac was not able to cool past 80 for a few days and when we called they were able to send matt, who was our technician, to our house the next morning. we originally received a very high repair quote  
from another company and wanted a second option. matt was honest and fair and fixed it for a fraction of the original quote from the other company. the ac did end up going out again but that was for a different issue which matt was able to fix. overall a great experience."
1967,it's painful to experience curb rash over a stupid error in judgement of wheel to curb distance.  i'm so glad that allow wheel repair specialists made the repair process easy and super quick.  i scuffed my wheel on a monday night and was able to get in by wednesday for a repair that took less than an hour.  i felt like the cost was reasonable and even received a yelp check-in discount.  i would highly recommend them.
1968,"shane came out to fix our garage door problem.  he was was very courteous and a hard worker.  however, a week later we had the same garage door problem.  this time another technician came out named andrew.  equally courteous, worked hard and was very knowledgeable.  he was very thorough in explaining to us what he had done.  he fixed the problem and there was no additional charge.  i would definitely  use a1 garage door repair again in the future."
1969,"surprised with the poor reviews on here.  mike was great!  scheduled the repair for 2 large glass patio doors and was expecting to pay over $250 for new rollers.  mike showed up on time, fixed both doors, only charged $95 and gave me good advice on maintenance.  both doors now work great! mike really knows his stuff.  my only ""complaint"" is that being a one-man business, he has to schedule things out in advance so a quick-turn repair is unlikely.  i would definitely call mike again for future repairs."
1970,travis gilbert was great!  our house was in need of repair of stucco and caulking prior to painting.  the house came out looking new!  travis and his crew did exactly what was agreed to and at the price agreed upon.  i highly recommend this company!
1971,"i came to check out the renovations, the staff was pretty friendly and i got a good vibe from the place."
1972,"met with endy and his technician today who did a fabulous job on my irrigation issues. i had several leaks and lots of trees, plants and shrubs that needed new emitters and many that did not have any water whatsoever! endy made sure that each and every plant and tree had water, make sure that each hose was buried correctly so my dogs would not chew on them and that each was adequately being watered. he contacted me promptly and met me at my property to give me a quote which was hands-down very reasonable. he and i arranged for a time the very next day and he showed up on time to do the job. he stayed until the job was completed and i was satisfied. i cannot be happier with his professionalism and the job that he did on my property.  i will definitely be using him again and would highly recommend him to anyone who needs irrigation repair."
1973,just plumbing came out to repairs a leak under home warranty. rick was awesome. scheduled another appointment for a kitchen faucet and garbage disposal to be installed. he is now our plumber.
1974,"progressive field is amazing. the renovations that were done over the last couple of years makes the stadium state of the art. progressive houses a myriad of local restaurants (i.e. melt, barrio, etc.). moreover, they have dollar dog night and fireworks. great place for a family or people looking to have a good time. go tribe."
1975,"fridge went down while family was out of town. you can imagine the mess and smell resulting from breakdown. called apex and couldn't get appointment until following day. fortunately song, the owner, called and they were able to come out 3 hours ahead of schedule. i envisioned the worse, but the end result was not that painful. the repair cost was fair, but more importantly, song was professional, friendly and wasted no time in determining the problem. fridge was repaired ( compressor starter) and they were done with repair, cleanup, vacuuming and out the door in under an hour. i'm a happy camper right now."
1976,"this is a great company to do business with and i couldn't recommend them more highly. i called and talked to adam on friday, he asked i send him photos of the issue at my home. i did and he provided me with a quote along with being able to come out monday (today) and get the issue resolved before closing. 

first thing monday morning and a tech was at my house getting to work. a couple of hours later i get a call and told everything is done and good to go for my house sell. the best part is they stuck to their quote and did an awesome job. 

i called another electrical company i found on yelp and they wanted over 3x the amount for the same repair. i will definitely have this company out to my new home for more work."
1977,"i have been a long term client of image sound and control (10 plus years) and am a big fan of their work.  they did the initial high end av build in my house when it was constructed.  since then, besides a few times when electrical components have failed, i have not had any problems with any of their work.  more importantly, when i have needed minor repairs or upgrades, they have always been responsive and knowledgeable.  don and bill there are excellent and i highly recommend them."
1978,"huge life saver! i received a quote on a brand new unit from another contractor and i felt it was really high....really really high. not knowing much about hvac, i asked a friend who referred me to terry at temperature source. i showed him my quote and he was beyond honest with me. 

he let me know a new unit was not necessary and that he could repair the existing unit for a fraction of the cost. i am so glad i didn't take the first quote at face value. he educated me about the business of hvac and how to look for trustworthy contractors. the insight and explanation was helpful and helped build instant rapport.

i would highly recommend terry and his crew at temperature source."
1979,"new roof on my mom's house is amazing.  looks great!  neighbors have made positive comments (and even other contractors have made positive remarks) about the quality job!!

working with the roofing company was awesome! everyone is very courteous. they also did repairs on my my house!"
1980,"we started here in january with guitar lessons for my son and have been very happy with everything. our instructor is excellent, he does a great job engaging my son in learning and practicing. they also sell instruments and do repairs. i'd definitely recommend them. great addition to the mcdowell mountain ranch community!"
1981,we called george brazil about a leak in our shower.  johnny espinoza arrived quickly and assessed the damage and parts needed to fix it.  throughout the repair johnny was calm and professional; our hyper little dog responded positively to his peaceful manner.  he cut a hole in the wall to repair the pipes and attached a new beautiful temperature control plate.  thanks to johnny espinoza of george brazil plumbing & electrical we are enjoying our new shower with no more leaks!
1982,boran was great to deal with and the repair was quick! highly recommend and thanks for making my daughter's day...
1983,"couldnt be happier with my experience! i'm selling my home and had a large list of small things i needed repaired. eric was able to quickly come in, get me a quote, and get a crew in within a week or so. their work was fantastic and i couldnt believe how quickly they got the work done. i've been recommending them to all of my neighbors and will definitely use them for my next project!"
1984,very helpful employees.  they steered me in he right direction and took the time to explain how to complete the repair i was doing on my kitchen sink.   i go here all the time and this is one the main reasons why.
1985,"we worked with abt on our home renovation. they remodeled our bathroom, put in all new windows and sliding glass door. as well as, updating all the electric throughout the home. this company is amazing angie, bob, bridget and all the rest of the people associated with getting our home in tip top shape to move into were fabulous to work with. they helped with everything from planning and designing to making recommendations for what we needed. we definitely will work with them again on future projects."

1989,"the mattex technicians are skilled in diagnosis as well as repairs. they are prompt, friendly, and their rates are reasonable. i use them both in my home and for the company i work for. i highly recommend mattex."
1990,"i filed a claim with the aroc (arizona register of contractors) and needed three estimates for the repair work. lion contractors made sure everything the aroc wanted done was covered in the contract and did not try to slip any ""extras"" in as necessary work. they also made sure i was aware of issues they found along the way, unrelated to the claim. they explained everything and completed the job in an outstanding manner.  everyone is respectful, not only with me but with each other. it was a pleasure to have them accomplish the work and the workmanship is outstanding. i have recommended them already, and will be having more work done in the near future."
1991,"roger was exceptional in communication from the get go.  first, he came over to check out the jobs so he could let us know pricing.  roger is a very competent handyman!  we were so happy to get all of our little repair jobs done.  i would not hesitate to use roger again!  he did excellent work!"
1992,"my garage door stopped working in the weekend. i called them on the saturday morning and got the same day appointment. ryan is very professional, polite and knowledgeable.  he explained what needed to repair and the different options. i ended up with the lifetime warranty one. i will definitely recommend them."
1993,"our ac unite quite about 6 pm friday in mid august so i called penguin air since my regular company was not able to make it till the next day. penguin air showed up within and hour and got the system up and running for a reasonable price. they saved the day,, or should i say that night. great company to call on when in need of emergency repairs."
1994,mamasan is the best bartender this place has! i liked the old worn down decor better than the new remodel (and not sure why they remodeled everything and left the bathrooms in such disrepair??). love the $3 hotdog & beer deal and its got great character for a locals bar on the strip. always the fav spot after work.
1995,"i had mr. handyman of south charlotte price out a number of items needing attention to our home. they came in right on budget and there technician joe was a true joy to have in our home. his work was incredible and he did his best to keep our home extremely clean while working. 
i most definitely would use them again and again!! keep up the great work!!"
1996,"ramon did a quick and easy timer replacement for me on christmas eve.  we had previously tried replacing the fuse and the transformer, and contacted affordable sprinkler repair when we knew we needed help with trying anything else.  ramon was very polite and professional, and we still definitely call them again for any additional work when needed."
1997,"affordable sprinkler is awesome. i do recommend using affordable sprinkler repair. i had them make a repair last summer to a drip valve and recently i thought that part began leaking again, so i called chris. he came out and discovered it was a new/different leak and made the repair. best of all he honored the warranty from the original repair. the best!!"
1998,"kitchen was remodeled. kitchen is beautiful, but a very small piece of molding needs replaced. there is a hole where it meets the cabinet. called a few times, they said on the list, but never came to repair it."
1999,i had my mazda6 repaired at excalibur.  everyone was super professional and friendly. the repairs were done a day ahead of when promised and the work was great! phenomenal communication too. highly recommended.
2000,this is a great company with great reliable guys.   no matter what the house problems they never let me down and always come up with a fix!    they did our beautiful home renovation 20 years ago and are as reliable on our current small maintenance projects as they were when they walked through our doors 20 years ago.   as a matter of fact a lot of the same people still work there.   it's a great family business!   can't recommend them enough!!!
2001,edit: after my previous review i was contacted by the owner of this company. he has stood behind both his technician and company which nowadays is rare. he explained all issues i had and warranty coverages which sets me at ease knowing i went with the right guys for my repair. it's great knowing they stand behind what they do and don't just push off problems to make a quick buck!!!!
2002,"the seal on my pump was failing, causing the motor to drip water.  k&k came out the next day and fixed it for a fair price.  i usually do my own repairs but now i will make a call to k&k."
2003,"it is a fantastic place, went today, sunday evening, and was by myself and 3 superfriendly young guards. i go swimming daily in every city i have to travel to and this was the best since a long time. clean water, good size, no frills (means all you want, but admittedly it needs a renovation). what agem folks, go as often as you can to keep it open."
2004,"jose came out today to check our drip line system. he was quick, efficient, knowledgeable and very friendly. highly recommend affordable sprinkler repair.  awesome job!"
2005,"our inspector was curtis.  he was professional, friendly and extremely knowledgeable! since the house was only 4 years old we were deciding if we even needed an inspection.  so glad we went ahead and hired ais.   curtis took photos and walked us through everything that needed repairs.  thanks so much, couldn't be happier!"
2006,"just in time before my chip grew too big to repair.  i got lucky on this one, timing was on my side for today."
2007,"wow!!! this is my first review where i wish i could give more stars. i called and spoke to john at 2pm today. he could not get my job  done because he was completely booked, and tomorrow he was leaving town. i told him i understood. we talked about a temporary fix, no go. bottom line, he came out to my job and did an excellent repair at a very fair cost. i could not be happier!!! thank you, john!!! i am grateful!!!"
2008,"quick, skillful, and professional. they did a great job on some repairs and i couldn't be happier. thank you"

2010,"i hired turn it on electric based on their reviews. there was some damages from their original install, but the owner came out to inspect it and had another contractor come out to fix the repairs. i would recommend using them, the employees are friendly and professional, especially pedro who came out to finish the job, i would highly recommend him for all of your electrical needs, pedro is very friendly and professional and went above and beyond to make sure i was completely happy with the job."
2011,"the renovation is now complete, and this location now has baked blue corn tortilla chips, although they were out last time i was there. if only they could get in some more of that 2006 hunter ashby merlot."
2012,"parkside villas has been home for my family since 2008. love the location, the staff has always been friendly and maintenance has always been on it with repairs."
2013,"this place is awesome. not only did they repair it quickly, but everything was completed professionally and properly. i highly recommend them."
2014,"i would recommend gabe. i hired him to do a few minor (for him) plumbing jobs. he went above and beyond what i asked him to do (at no additional charge). 

i gave him four stars (not five) because we did talk about getting a new hot water heater installed and he gave me a verbal quote of about $700 to $800 (as did some other reputable plumbers who i talked with later). i don't know why plumbers charge so much to install hot water heaters... i ended up going to home depot and buying one for $250 and had a handyman install it for $100."
2015,"contacted several handymen to do a couple of work for me at a rental property in inspirada. paul was the only one that responded. he did a great job. he is prompt, reliable, and his rates were great. too bad he doesn't do work in las vegas. but i can understand why. he would not be able to be a good handyman if he is all over the place. i would definitely recommend him to anyone and use him again! thanks paul."
2016,"our refrigerator was leaking and we couldn't figure out from where. i was trying to avoid spending money on a repair company, as i like to think of myself as a jack of all trades, and tried everything to fix it myself.  i quickly realized that refrigerators are beyond my level of expertise and came to terms that i needed a professional.  ilya was exactly that, ""a professional"", he showed up on time, got straight to the point and within an hour all my headaches with the leaky fridge were gone.  he changed some seals and worked some magic and he was on his way.  ilya was great and the cost was great too. if anything breaks again, i'm calling him right away and not even going to try and tinker with it myself. 

thank you!"
2017,"great selection and staff. if they don't have it, they can find it - otherwise they can work at making it.  excellent repair work."
2018,"120 degrees. sunday evening.  fathers day.  you guessed it, the a/c at my rental property is making funny noises.  can the timing possibly get any worse? 

i called dukes around 500 pm and the issue was fixed by 815 pm.  i am happy, the tenant is happy. win win for everyone.  i was kept abreast of the repairs and received a thorough report from john, who was professional and friendly.  

i would highly recommend arizona dukes of air."
2019,"brian came out to give me an estimate on replacing a big bay garage door at my work.  he looked at the door and asked "" why are you replacing it?""  i was told by 2 other companies that it needed to be replaced and was given estimates to do so.  about 1 hour later he had the door repaired.  it has been weeks now and the door works great.  i will be recommending them to friends, family and customers.  thank you brian and the guys at smokey's garage door for being a great honest company!"
2020,"5 stars! i gotta tell ya these guys are the best. a stand up company who stands by their work. hoa ignores roof issue, so we bypass hoa and go straight to complex' contractor. dennis and randy repair, fix in no time. recent rains brought another issue (not porter's fault) and owner dennis appeared within hours to look at damage and offered to go beyond what we expected.  hire them."
2021,"i must say paul is awesome!   i had been calling around the henderson, nv area looking for help with fixing a very small issue - a window blind that was stuck and would not pull down. the persons living in the property wanted it fix.  period.   i recently brought the property and do not live in the area and do not know anybody in the area, so i just looked on yelp and saw the great reviews for paul's small job and reached out.  i had been looking for weeks, either my calls not returned or was rejected because the job was just way too small and not worth the effort (i was told).

paul returned my call, arranged to take on the small job, completed it in the time frame he said he would, and kept me updated at each step of the way!  i am sooooooooooo impressed by his professionalism, consciousness to do a good job, and his great communications skills!   my tenants are happy and so am i.  

he is my handyman from here on out!  and i will highly recommend him!!!!

debra"
2022,"my ipad mini had to have the charging socket and called 3 or 4 places for repair. every place told around 5 to 7 days and $100 to $150 charge. 

called these guys and they were able to fix it in an hour and charged only $50.

amazing work."
2023,"this is the second time i have rented from black and cherry. their team is top notch, i never have a problem with repairs and they always have people on hand after hours to help us when we need it. i am so thankful i found black and cherry and i wouldn't rent from anyone else!"

2025,"showers need serious repair, but free shuttle to the strip and decent casino next door, very friendly owner and staff."
2026,"i can not say enough good things about these guys. i had them out in 2011 to repair our freus system which they had to almost completely rebuild due to lack of use because the house was vacant for many years. fast forward to 2017 and it's having problems again. they came out same morning and figured out the problem and didn't even charge me!
they are amazing!!!"
2027,"brandon came to our home today to repair pet damage my little fur baby did to the threshold of my room. he was very polite and professional, introduced himself and didn't make things awkward. he held a conversation with me and answered all questions i had. definitely knew what he was doing with his 12 years experience and you can't even tell where the damage was done! highly recommend this company!"

2029,"a very impressive company with outstanding associates in the field!   i just had the pleasure of meeting two employees of larson air conditioning, victor ramirez & lyle, and i was totally impressed with their professionalism, their courtesy, their knowledge of what needed to be done....and the speed with which they attended to the repair and headed out to their next stop.  these are top flight pro's and if you need hvac work, i urge you to give them a shot.... you will not regret it."
2030,"when i learned that part that i needed for repair would not be available for couple months, corey offered to ""temp"" fix my window at no charge!  can't say many other places would do the same.  great guy!  down to earth and very knowledgeable!  will recommend to all my friends."
2031,"wow!  thank you yelp!  and thank you tommy and a1.  i made an appointment last week on-line for 1 door repair and inspection of the other. i received prompt confirmation of the appointment and then the most amazing notification text this morning that introduced our technician, shane d, and included for our safety, was a photo and a little about shane.  i thought that touch was especially thoughtful.  the professional assessment, quote and subsequent repairs exceeded our expectations.  

i can't recommend them enough for their professional communication and workmanship. this town is about referrals and word of mouth (verbal or written) and i encourage you to look or read no further thank a1!!"
2032,"it's not often anymore that you find a reliable a/c professional who is on-time, honest, dependable, and patient with his customers.  mike and his team quoted a job for me and went the extra mile to see that it was done right, and on budget.  they knew about my construction deadlines, and worked until 10pm on a friday night in order to keep me on schedule.  i would highly recommend affirmative air for your air conditioning repair needs, or in my case, a quad-zone mini-split install.  a+ in my book."
2033,"amazing gym, super friendly staff, great atmosphere. if something needs repaired, they are on it. if you drop a suggestion it's done. been going for over 6yrs, wouldn't go anywhere else!"

2035,"we worked with greg. he was fantastic, helped us decide on wood shutters for our kitchen and the installers were really great too. we didn't pay until our shutters came in and greg kept in touch with us. while he was here we thought we were going to have to get new blinds in our living and den area too. nope! greg called up a friend who does repairs and hence we got those fixed for 100$. this allowed us to be able to afford the kitchen shutters, something we have wanted for a while. he treated us like friends and we were so thankful! highly recommend and we woudl use again for sure!"
2036,"yum. filling, juicy burgers and fries that will make every mcgill skinny girl thick af. quick bite around mcgill, although its been closed for renovation fo a while now. can't wait for it to reopen though, great if you wanna grab a bite close to campus."

2038,"i have a baldwin dc 100 baby grand piano, that suddenly had power failure. i was referred to 911 keys & sound from another reputable piano repair place. alex told me upfront what the initial charge would be. he was very courteous, helpful and was able to repair the piano to my surprise on the first visit.  saving me more time and money.

i definitely would use 911 keys & sound again with confidence."
2039,i hired certapro painters to paint the exterior of my home and the block walls. they did a fantastic job. they were professional and very good at communication. reasonable pricing too for excellent quality. my exterior stucco needed a lot of repairs. you would never know it now. i highly recommend them.

2041,i have had this company out two times and their work is great. they never try to fix things that don't need to be fixed but do proved suggestions. i will continue to use this company for all my sprinkler and lawn repairs.

2043,"creative, talented, innovative, cooperative, sensitive, friendly, thoughtful- all words used to describe the wonderful work done by chad rothe and team at lightform lighting. happy as larks with the lighting in our renovated home after 6 years. still enjoying the variety of lights and overall lighting design for our contemporary renovation. chad listens and delivers!!"
2044,we love living at latitude especially with all of the new amenities and renovations. the staff is friendly and responds to the best of their abilities to accommodate our maintenance requests or questions. our neighbors have become our friends. we have a blast doing events and activities and are always meeting someone new. latitude isn't perfect but then again no place is. but things are definitely looking up at latitude!
2045,"can't say enough about the amazing work done by jennifer and her team. my townhouse was in desperate need of attention, and required a lot of fill work/wall repairs and then new paint on 20 ft vault walls/ceilings and all trim repainted.  the team turned it around ahead of schedule and the unit looked brand new. all of this would have been enough, but on top of that, the crew was great with communicating, were polite, courteous and timely, and cleaned up everything like they were never even there.  i would highly recommend action painting pros to anyone who wants the best.  thanks jenn and team!"
2046,amanda b at vanity is awesome! i was in from vegas for only two days and she is the only stylist i could find in scottsdale that knows how to do beaded weft extensions. i needed a repair on just one bead and she completely hooked it up. plus she was super sweet. thank you!!
2047,"brandon, the technician arrived withing the scheduled time, was very cheerful and after first discussing the problem with him (had an electrical short on our roof-top trane heat pump), was quickly up on the roof diagnosing the problems.  he found a burnt relay and a wire shorting to a copper coolant line, and quickly solved both problems within one and a half hours.  the cost of repair was very reasonable and saved another $35 using the angies list repair coupon.  my present hvac company sent 5 tech's on 4 appointments and couldn't solve the problem !  brandon did it in 1 !  great job brandon, we're switching to schiller h&c !"
2048,"was looking for a reputable place to take my '04 land rover discovery--which parts can be expensive for.

i've always received a friendly and professional attitude from these guys. i highly recommend ali and his team."
2049,i wish i knew about this company when i purchased my ac system. the owner made the repair call today. he was honest and fair. he clearly communicated the issue and what we can do to prolong the life of our system. it is refreshing to have a honest and fair repair company.
2050,"thoroughly went through all of our options and explained what was wrong with our system. included detailed pictures and pricing options, from a simple repair option to new unit options. ended up installing a new unit...work was all done in 1 day and the difference is amazing. very professional and pricing was better than the 2 other companies that we had quotes from concerning a replacement unit. they beat one well known company by over $1000! highly recommend this company!"

2056,"7 years ago i had them replace my ac unit at my home.  i was happy with them at that time.  but over the last two days i have become a very happy customer.   my ac unit went out on thursday.  i called them at 4:15 in the afternoon.  they had someone out at my house less than 2 hours later.   he found the problem and told me that my unit was under warranty!   i thought that my warranty had expired! he did not have the part to fix it (understandable)  i got a call the next morning at about 8am letting me know that they had got the part needed.   a time was set from 10:30-1:00 that day for the repair.   i just asked for a call 30 min prior to the tech getting there as i was going to have to leave work.  i got the call only 15 min before (the only thing i am not happy about)  when i got home my ac was working again less than 24 hours after it stopped working.  both techs that came out were professorial  (kasey,  antonio)."
2057,they repaired a broken strap on a deceased family member's beloved briefcase. beautiful job on the repair and the reconditioning too! very nice staff!

2064,"we looked for a long time for a competent, reliable handyman before we found kent. in the last two years kent has made multiple trips to our house fixing plumbing, electrical, lighting and other items. he has always been reliable and  does  quaiity work for a reasonable fee."
2065,"i just stopped in quickly to have a necklace repaired, and matt was fantastic! he was extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and he was able to fix my necklace very quickly. it was a pleasure working with matt, and i will definitely be returning with more jewelry to be fixed. i highly recommend this location!"
2066,"my drip line irrigation developed a crack and started leaking.  thankfully, ramon from affordable sprinkler repair was able to sort things out and fix the problem.  ramon also helped me with some problems i was having with my irrigation timer.  i will use affordable sprinkler repair again if i have a problem."
2067,"a few weeks ago my air conditioner was making an extremely loud noise and cold air wasn't coming out of my air registers so i called penguin air to take a look. turns out my blower had gone out and wasn't blowing air.

the technician was able to get the part quickly and had it repaired in a little more than an hour. 

turns out it was my fault, i hadn't changed the filter in a ""long"" time and the blower was having to work harder which caused it to fail. the tech had a filter on him so we changed it on the spot.

overall a really good experience with penguin air and would definitely recommend them."
2068,"i am visiting charlotte from arizona and was in need of a lash fill/repair. i found lala lashes on google maps and i'm so thankful i did. 
charryse is professional, friendly and fast!
she asked me important lash questions proving she knows her stuff (brand i had already, length i had already, style i had already) and even though i didn't have any of the answers she didn't make me feel bad about it... just jumped in and gave me the prettiest lashes ever!!!"
2069,"we called another company and they told we had to replace the whole roof, we were just about to do that when a friend told us to call porter roofing. dennis was very professional and told us that we only had to repair the damaged portion, he saved us about 8,000 because he told us the truth, and was not out to just take advantage of us like some companies that are just chasing the money"
2070,"my daughters and i moved into the current rental in march of 2016 and have had the best luck.  we have had a couple of repairs and they were completed in a very timely manner and mario and renee have been nothing short of kind wonderful to work with.

2075,"these are great guys and i am really happy to give them my business and to post this review.  they repaired my 22 year old unit.  responded the same day, had all the parts on the truck, and repaired the unit.  the two technicians got up into the hot attic, and took several photos of the air handler unit for my review.  we all agreed i need a new unit, but the repair will last through the 2017 summer.  support these guys, you will be happy.  thank you, alien!"

2077,"wanted to share my thoughts about phil's home maintenance as they have done a lot of great work for me over the past year.

i actually found out about phil's from one of their employees who is related to a friend of mine.  phil's can do a lot of general ""handyman"" type things.  i have asked them to do a variety of tasks for me in the past, including:
 - indoor/outdoor painting
 - grouting
 - caulking and sealing
 - changing out hardware
 - installing lighting
 - tile cutting

phil's charges a trip fee that includes your first 30 minutes of work.  you pay based on the amt of time that they spend on your job and any supplies that are needed (they have a well-stocked truck that enables them to do lots of stuff at your home).

i highly recommend phil's home maintenance for all your small jobs around the house!  they make a great handyman!"
2078,deadbolt for my front door was broken so i called to have it repaired and the lock was fixed same day so i highly recommend using this company
2079,"i love this place. this is the best repair facility that i have ever been to. they are supper professional. the work was amazing. i couldn't even tell anything happened to my truck after they were finished. 

i would recommend this place to everyone"
2080,came here with my tour group and was pleasantly surprised. the excalibur has undergone some recent renovations. they have included a kids arcade complete with fairway games. the rooms are well-appointed and they've simplified to a simple shower rather than a shower-over-tub. probably one of the more family friendly resorts.
2081,"great work and a reasonable price. i was in and out in less than an hour for both window repairs. very knowledgeable and took the extra time to show me what went wrong with the motor and regulators in my windows.  highly recommend,  already spread the word to a couple friends!"
2082,10/10 company. ray and tatum are experts with home renovations and have great personable skills. their company has done several home projects for clients of mine. they can do something as simple as repairs all the way to building you your own custom home. when you think general contracting.. think ray ouellette.
2083,"can't say enough positive things about the quality of the work. exceptional. professionalism was appreciated as well. here is what accomplished: installed attic ladder above garage including trim around opening, installed decking for storage above garage, replaced attic fan with quieter and more efficient and more powerful version, installed decking above main portion of the house, installed hanging storage racks in garage and installed garage organizer wall mounts to hold brooms, rakes etc. i now have used the new storage capacity at our house to empty the double storage unit saving almost $300 each month that we got 6 years ago thinking was for one summer. i should have hired handyman matters 5 years ago!"

2085,"i recently used kal to paint a few houses that were left to me by my parents that i was trying to sell.  i am a younger guy, and have never dealt with anything as big as trying to repair three homes and get them prepped for sale, but i have to say kal went above and beyond the call of duty in keeping the projects affordable, as well as guiding me through what should be done, all while making the houses look great. his communication was fantastic and he was very helpful in giving advice to keep costs down. he also made a few other improvements to the houses that were not even painting-related, he is just a kind hearted person who wanted to help where he could.  he painted a total of three houses for me, and all were completed in a timely manner.  we actually came in under budget on what he originally quoted me due to his good business sense.  i would highly recommend kal to anyone who needs painting done in the area, and i will be using him again for any future projects."
2086,"we had an issue with the outside electrical involving the main gfi and 2 other outdoor outlets. we are so impressed with his ability to troubleshoot, find the problem and make the necessary repairs that i had to express it on yelp. what a"" great representative"" tap electric has in raul...he exceeded our expectations
paul & liz"
2087,"sibo has been doing electrical work for me for years.  i just signed up for yelp, so i thought i'd give them a shout-out.  their pricing is fair and they are always reliable.  i've dealt mostly with dean, who is very knowledgable.  their quality is top-notch.  over the years, they've installed ceiling fans for me, an attic exhaust fan, exterior lighting and other electrical repair work.  i'd recommend sibo to anyone."
2088,"the guys at affordable sprinkler repair are amazing. they made an appointment quickly and showed up right on time. i had a very simple repair, and i appreciated that they didn't make me feel dumb for not realizing my relief valve was off.

i would recommend them to anyone."
2089,"this spot is closed for renovations. from peaking in the front window, looks like they are doing some extensive work, so it might be shuttered for a while."
2090,aaron just finished up a small repair for me and did a great job. highly recommended. i had a hard time getting someone out and actually follow thru with estimates and doing the work. aaron came out and did what he said and when he would do it.
2091,"this is an update of the negative review i posted about cool air now ac repair (canacr) on september 9, 2015, here on yelp.

on friday, september 11, 2015, a mr. tim naas of canacr called me.  he said that he had become aware of my dissatisfaction, and that canacr wanted all of their customers to be 100% satisfied with their employees' work.  therefore, he said that since i was not 100% satisfied, he would send me a full refund of the $200 i paid canacr.  when i returned friday from a temporary duty assignment in san diego, i had a 100% customer satisfaction check in the amount of $200 from canacr.

thank you mr. naas and cool air now ac repair for doing the right thing."
2092,"came here with a bum truck on the way home from family road trip...scott and his crew hooked us up with a repair lickety split. even gave us $ off and pez dispensers for all 3 kids! it was such a relief in such a crappy situation. thanks for helping us out and sending us on our way. wish you'd warned us about the lv traffic :) jk
ps - they even called us the next day to make sure that we made it home to california safely.  doesn't get much better!  thanks again!"
2093,"we had a great experience with affordable sprinkler repair. ramon came and fixed 2 leaks. i used to ask mexican guys who used to come over to cut my palm trees for any repair, but they stopped coming. this was the first time i had to call for sprinkler repair. it was very reasonable and he fixed it very quickly.  i will recommend them if anyone needs sprinkler repair."
2094,thank you alex! always fast and very affordable! i've had three boots repaired here and he is truly a life saver when it comes to a broken heel!
2095,i have lived at bermuda terrace for a year and a half and have enjoyed living here with the friendly staff and great neighbors. kendall is very quick with any minor repairs that are needed and the grounds are maintained to luxury living standards.

2098,"tanya arredondo- i've been living here for over 10 yrs i can honestly say that i love this place!!  this place has a sense of family. the staff is very friendly and the maintenance crew do an excellent job at fulfilling my repair request in a timely manner but the most important thing is that i feel very safe living here i've come home from work at all hours of the night and always see a security guard walking the grounds , i would highly recommend living here"
2099,they are just amazing! i just moved here from socal and my husband is away for work. our shock needed repair and i didn't know where to go. my neighbor suggested i try knuckle busters and i am beyond glad i did. they fix it on the spot and hooked me up! their staff is amazing and helped me out when i truly needed it. there is no other place i'd go. thank you knuckle busters you made my day!
2100,"andy b was awesome.  very prompt in his arrival, diagnosis and repair.  very courteous as well."
2101,i was in need of an umbilical hernia repair and went to a couple physicians for consultations. shawn made me feel the most comfortable and left me with no questions about the procedure. shawn and his staff at chandler hospital were great and very comforting. i had a mesh put in laparoscopically and have my 4 week anniversary of the procedure tomorrow... i would strongly recommend him for any hernia repair. a++ and very personable and professional!
2102,"i am pretty handy with guitars, but mine (not purchased there) was cutting out.  i replaced a few things and finally conceded i was in over my head.

i took it in and within 24 hours it was returned to me fully functioning.  more importantly, the cost of the repair was only $20.  i am not suggesting the average repair for a guitar would be anywhere near $20 bucks.  what it does tell me though is they don't take advantage of a situation if the repair is minor on their end."
2103,"we had a great experience with dana and dennis when looking for a 4runner for our son.  they were easy to deal with, followed through on all repairs  they promised to complete prior to our purchase and did not pressure us.  highly recommend."

2105,we had a very thorough inspection with tom. he really took his time and pointed everything that was not to code or in need of repair. he went through the items one by one and was extremely helpful in pointing out what was a large problem and was something standard for the age of the home or an easy fix. i'd use this company again.
2106,"i've worked with gonzales heating & cooling quite a few times -- i was employed through a company that coordinated repairs for a housing program- i used gonzales at least 30 times in 2 years. gonzales heating & cooling always treated our clients well and were consistently priced under the competition- we almost always got calls from clients complimenting the professionalism and courtesy of the tech that went out and  thanking us for sending them. because of this i chose to use them on my own home when i bought  new ac unit in 2010- very happy with everything.  5 years later, i had to call them out for an issue - called on sunday evening and they had a tech out at 8am on monday (which is a big deal in the middle of august in phx!) they are a great company to use- always super friendly and trustworthy.  i definitely recommend!"
2107,"hands down the only company i will ever deal with for anything hvac related. valley's best has replaced our ac unit in our old place and repaired our unit at our new house. on every encounter with them they have been professional, honest, respectful and have a great sense of urgency. the owner chase is honest and knowledgeable. marlene the office manager is incredible she truly goes above and beyond and is such a compassionate individual. the techs who came to our were super knowledgeable and quick to resolve the issues. highly recommended this company for your heating and cooling needs."
2108,emily did a botanical treatment to repair damage & it was amazing! she has also given me a pedicure in the past & that was very relaxing as well!!!
2109,"jack m, was our plumber today and he did a fantastic job. he did a total inspection and explained any issues we had and gave us suggestions for future maintenance.   he gave us options for several things and did two repairs while he was here.  he was very personable and friendly. he called before arriving and was actually early.  we highly recommend jack and george brazil!

 john e came  today to  do our annual electrical inspection as well as solve an issue with our smoke detectors.   he did an exceptional job and gave us insight on things we weren't aware of. he explained things well and took the time to answer any and all questions.  john was very professional and thorough.  he was very prompt and called to let us know he was on his way, and arrived early! john is very personable and friendly and we would highly recommend to anyone needing an expert electrician.  thanks to both jack m and john e for doing an exceptional job today!"

2112,"i initially contacted j&a home improvement for a deck resurfacing.  i removed old flagstone and updated it with a new ""kool deck"" surface.  the project ran smooth, on schedule and the j&a team communicated effectively with me.   ...and it looked great.   
i did run into a couple of problems after the fact.   one of them i had been cautioned to be aware of and the other was my fault.   my ultimate 5-star rating was based on j&a's work and repairs to the surface, which were literally undetectable.
great work and good guys!"
2113,"thanks to victor d'agostino for a fine repair and doing what you promised for the price you quoted. nice doing business with and i recommend that anyone looking to get furniture and i imagine general finish woodworking at least talk to victor first. 
jim"
2114,"i have a peavey valve king 100 that just stopped working one day. i checked the fuse and replaced it. the light came on, but no sound. i needed to take it in somewhere. i came across ampmedic after searching online. i requested a quote and phil called me right away. i made an appointment to drop it off. we met and talked. he's very knowledgeable and has been doing this for many years. after a week of communication via emails with what was going on with my amp and pictures my amp was fixed. turns out there are internal fuses that are soldered to the board and i had some bad tubes. so i now have new fuses and all new matching power tubes and the bias set. amp sounds better than when i bought it and it seems louder too. i would highly recommend phil for your amp repair needs. thanks again."
2115,"i cannot say enough good things about this company. from the get-go, they were very communicative. from texting me and exchanging pictures of pieces that had broken off my washer, to making sure to call me 15 minutes ahead of time to allow me time to get home from work. the repair man fixed my washer fixed in a timely manner. he was professional and courteous. i definitely recommend them."
2116,"needed a little drywall repair, paul arrived on time, made quick work out of a ceiling crack. affordable & efficient...5 star"
2117,"i can't say enough good things about arizona beemer repair! bryan and trinity are professional, knowledgeable and always a pleasure to work with. i've been taking my 2002 530i to them for years now and bryan has always been able to pinpoint the exact problem and fix it right the first time. people say don't buy a bmw because of the expensive repair costs, this has not been my experience at all thanks to abr, the bill has always been more than reasonable. thank you guys so much, you are the reason i'm still driving and loving my bmw!"
2118,"ac repair and maintenance can be daunting as you never really feel comfortable with the diagnosis. patrick made me feel at ease however and was a pleasure to work with. his pricing was very competitive, he took the time out to explain everything to me, and not once did i feel he was trying to sell me something i really didnt need. i highly recommend you consider arid valley for your ac needs!"
2119,had a great time at alloy wheel repair today. very quick & quality job done to my oem bmw wheel. danielle was very helpful. will recommend anyone with any curb rash on their wheels. thanks again guys!
2120,"i needed the icemaker in my refrigerator replaced. i called e & j (based on their rating) and was not disappointed.  i called and made an appointment-- a two hour window. the repairman, joey, called near the beginning of that time window and gave me a 30 minute heads up. (i love that courtesy.)  he was nice, polite, and- bonus for my dogs-- pooch friendly. in no time the ice maker was out and he confirmed it's useless status. since i had given e & j the model specifications, he came prepared to replace it right away, and he gave me a good price. i took it and he was soon done, cleaned up ( i also noted that he was respectful of my things while he worked), and gone. 
   it has been a week and everything works perfectly."
2121,i called ben he asked for a video and picture of model number he immediately went to look for the part and gave me straight answers. people like this are so refreshing to work with. thank you for being a comen sense honest repair man.
2122,"so i posted a very critical review but mike the regional manager came to assess the damage caused by the previous crew. the following day (today) jacob came and did the repairs to my complete satisfaction. one heat selection knob will be available and he will quickly stop by to replace it. mike and jacob knew what they were doing and did so in a very professional way. so between the 1 star ten days ago and the 5 stars today, i will give it a 4 (i know math says it should be three but they made ever effort to make good on it."
2123,"paul did three small jobs for me over two visits - replaced a garbage disposal, removed and replaced a broken vanity sink, and replaced a dimmer switch.  i provided all the parts, except for silicon and a pipe that worked with the new sink.  paul was  prompt, friendly and worked very quickly.  he will be my new go-to handyman for any minor jobs that come up.  i highly recommend him."
2124,"i have used quick response multiple times for garage door repairs or garage door replacement. i buy and sell a lot of houses so im always on the hunt for good vendors. these guys are great! they communicate extremely well, their response time is excellent, they do a great job, and their pricing is fair. would highly recommend and i will personally continue to use them."
2125,"my ac went out today on the hottest day of the year, 116 degrees. i called meyer's air conditioning this morning and jimmy was able to come out a few hours later. professional, efficient and reasonable. was able to diagnose and repair the problem.  meyer's air conditioning is a local family owned business. i have been a loyal customer for 14 years, and am relieved that my home is starting to cool down."
2126,i have used josh on three separate occasions to repair both my dryer and my washer. each time he has done a good job and charged reasonably.
2127,"this is sort of like a goodwill for home renovations. 

we found a couple of light fixtures in our house that we didn't need so i figured it would make sense to donate them. they happily took the lights and we walked around a little bit. there are a ton of windows and doors for sale, plus a whole kitchen including cabinets, lots of hardware, paint, etc. it's a great place to check out for discounted new/used items if you're doing any redecorating. i was hoping they'd have some faucets, but no luck this time around. i was able to get a tiny can of spray paint for $2.50, though! now maybe people will stop stealing our recycling bin!

staff were super friendly."
2128,"one of the best spicy place in the area, i also love how they newly renovated the restaurant. after the renovation, the restaurant looks like a greenery lounge with wooden tables, a huge difference from their original look which was just a typical chinese restaurant look. 
they're very accommodating with diet restrictions, and they have a huge selection of beers."
2129,"a very reliable and honest company.  highly recommend this company to anyone needing a/c repair.  also would like the company know about the excellent technician that was sent to my place. very punctual,  honest, professional and  knows his business inside and out.  hope the company appreciates such a model employee.  his name is robert.  simply the best.  will recommend this company to all of my friends."

2131,"we had jason out again (for a different repair) on our old sprinkler system. ended up a broken pipe. he fixed it in record time.
 he is truly a find! i hope the company realizes what a gem they have and never let him go (or better yet, give him a raise!) because he is great! he always shows up when he says or calls to check in. doesn't over charge or upsell. 
we will continue to use affordable sprinkler repair as long as jason is with them!"

2135,"finding a good handyman is hard. i am so lucky that i found greg! he can fix pretty much anything, he doesn't over charge and he's super nice! i called a plumbing company ( several ) to get an estimate to install a new faucet.... same one i already had just a new one..... no kidding. i was quoted 250-500 just to do that! i came across greg via a friend and he did it for much less!!! like i always call him when anything breaks now before calling anyone else!!! he knows his stuff ! he does big jobs and also likes the small jobs! if you need a reliable and awesome handyman call greg! i refer him to everyone i know!!!!"

2139,"my wife took out a curb and took chunks out of her rims in the process.  as you'll see in the photos, it was nasty, with metal gouged out and sharp edges all over where the chunks came out.  found rim repair online and sent a quick text with an attached photo.  got a pretty fast reply - on a friday after 5pm! - saying it would be $150 and they could be out on monday between 10am and 1pm.  got a text from them at 10:40am monday saying they were on their way.  once they'd arrived, they began working on the rim, and the ""after"" photo clearly speaks for itself.  they did an amazing job!  highly recommended!!!  thanks, rim repair!"

2142,"finally getting a chance to write my review! i've been renting from atlas for over three years and to have the consistency of the same agent has been amazing. angela v has been the professional from the very beginning. any repairs needed have been arranged in a timely manner and being able to communicate with her in the same fashion has been a peace of mind, for myself. thank you for continually making my renting experience pleasant!"
2143,"andy b was awesome.  very prompt in his arrival, diagnosis and repair.  very courteous as well."
2144,"drytech was very fast, reliable, and beyond professional! my home got water damage and i swear i didnt know what to do but after speaking with mr. eduard mirzoian, i felt 100 times better! we were able to dry the home and remove everything out so that renovations can begin. if you ever need any type of restoration....drytech is the way to go!"
2145,"fast, professional, knowledgable, and very affordable.  they guarantee their work for a year!  i can't say enough good things about these guys.  i had no idea who to call and i got very lucky when i called affordable sprinkler repair!"
2146,we just bought a new beautiful iron front door from iron doors arizona.  from the minute we walked into the show room everyone was there to help as a team and made us comfortable. tim was our sales rep. and was awesome. we found the perfect door then he came out to measure and informed us of everything that would need to be done in order for that door to fit.  the install was on time and they were amazing. then their stucco/wallboard repair guy came out and spent hours making sure it looks amazing inside and out.  love this place and all their people.  thank you for making this experience so wonderful.
2147,our upstairs air stopped working. a repair man came within 30 minutes. they had the parts with them and fixed immediately. very fast and affordable!!! i would definitely recommend and use air for less again.
2148,"if every business, vacuums, or otherwise, had the same customer orientation as this place, the world would be fantastic! my hats off to the owner, greg, and wes, who kindly considered my needs as a customer, before their need to make a profit. now, that is unheard of! forget about the other places with their slick radio ads! vacuum specialist's selection of vacuums and accessories blows away anyone else in the city! that is the icing on the cake! you know what? i will never go anywhere else for repair and accessories and will recommend them to all my acquaintances. thanks, guys!"
2149,"i contacted ben over yelp as i was in need of an inspection on my furnace and ac unit. ben was very prompt to respond. he was also very communicative. the day of the appointment ben called to tell me he was on his way. when ben showed up for the appointment he explained to me what he was going to do. he asked me if i wanted to follow him around as he did the inspection. i did and before he performed a test he told me what the results should be. this way i would know he wasn't trying to pull one over on me. ben was very personable, professional, and a great repair man. i would highly recommend air tech. they go above and beyond the norm."
2150,these people were very professional.  on time and found our leak. he repaired it in quick order.  returned a week later ( on time) to repait the ceiling. very happy. very satisfied.
2151,i'm very glad we decided to go with dukes of air for our ac repair. tom came out right away on a saturday morning! he was very knowledgeable and knew right away what was wrong. we will definitely call them again in the future.
2152,"spencer is now our favorite handyman in town. he saved our butts, literally, by demolishing our deck. he did it in fewer hours than he estimated. he dealt with a few unexpected surprises on our property. it was not an easy job by any means. we wouldn't hesitate to hire him again. very reasonable rates."
2153,"the work done by the technician was flawless. when i asked my daughter to show me where the damage had been, she was unable to point it out. the technician was prompt and arrived exactly when he said he would and completed the work and the time he said he would. from now on any rim repair i have or can recommend will go here."
2154,"our drains slowed.  i attemped to remove the pvc trap under our sink and the old glavanized pipe behind crumbled into my hand.  we have a home warranty, but they denied coverage since i was the one who ""broke"" the pipe.  the company they sent out quoted me a price to fix the problem, which didn't include the repairs needed for paint, drywall and reinstalling a bathroom vanity.  i decided to get a 2nd opinion.

i called accent and they came out same to day to assess and give me an estimate.  the estimate was about 1/2 what the other vendor quoted.  i gave them the job.

the next morning, jim was at my house and started work.  he worked diligently the whole morning and completed the job in 2 hours less than estimated, which ended up saving me even more money.  additionally, he was able to do the work without having to cause and damage to the walls outside of the sink cabinets/vanities, so i have no additional repair work to do!

this was all around a great experience, especially having just come off a terrible one with my home warranty and their vendor.  jim at accent will definitely be my go-to from now on."
2155,todd was great!! he was honest with us and sent us what repairs he made! we are in the process of selling our house and making repairs for the buyer so this was very helpful!  he also made sure to charge us fairly for what was needed. we will definitely use them again!!! thank you todd!!
2156,they worked for me after being referred to them by our local plumbing supply house.   completely satisfied.  jim wallace came to my house same day i called.  quote was received within 30 minutes of leaving my house.   the repair and ultimate installation was professionally completed.  he also worked well with and was very accommodating with the other contractor who was working on the project.
2157,these guys are just great to work with.  they rebuilt my motor same day and gave me lots of tips on how to repair thing perfectly.  wouldn't ever go any place else
2158,"one call was a recommendation from our friends.  they were right.  i needed to redo all of the rock around the house and yard.  they came out, gave me an estimate and completed the work today.  the owners don't just come out and do the estimate and have others do the work.  they were on site at the start, checked in often and checked at completion.  the owner, kurth also repaired a sprinkler for no charge, checked the settings on my sprinkler systems to make sure they were okay for summer.  pay in cash or check and you can save.  complete professionals, it just does not get any better than this.  highly recommend and will use them in the future."
2159,"paul is excellent. he was at my house today to fix a few things. he's skilled, innovative quick & affordable. i'll all him soon again for handyman needs. thanks paul!"

2162,hired to repair a door frame and install the door.  was very professional and affordable.  would absolutely hire paul again and recommend him to others
2163,"sent through yelp to get a few quotes.  i explained pretty clearly what it was and would like repair quote.  most places insisted needed new opener for huge sums of money.  not jdt, gave me a great quote, super helpful, fast answers.  gave me a small window of time, (not like some places of ""between 8-5""). korey text, was there when he said, and his partner in crime were in and out in record time.  super polite, and did some lubing of the door!!!!   put these guys on speed dial."
2164,"dukes of air gets an a+ today.   super polite/knowledgeable tech, got right to the problem quickly and before i knew it my unit was repaired, pumping cold air again.  

couldn't have been more satisfied. 

thanks mark!!!!!!"
2165,"i highly recommend val doors! jesse fixed a door at my condo after my pooch had damaged it. after the repairs, the door was ascetically perfect and functioned better than when i initially moved in. jesse is very professional, was accommodating with my schedule and i would absolutely contact him again for another job."
2166,"run down but friendly. the place needs major renovations, but the beds are comfortable the sheets are clean and the people are wonderful. my only suggestion would be to install a water filter or provide shelter water. the water in the water dispenser comes from the tap. phoenix water tastes like mud."
2167,"we have worked with phoenix home remodeling on a few jobs recently and are really impressed by their renovation work.
i've seen their bathroom remodels, kitchen remodels and other interior remodel work. their attention to detail on these renos is fantastic. 
i've never seen such organized contractors in phoenix when it comes to their technology, scheduling, and processes.
if you need a good home remodel contractor in arizona, phoenix home remodeling is amazing."
2168,"what a wonderful experience. i had no trouble booking an appointment. michelle was terrific sending me an estimate right away. dennis called to let me know he was on his way, arrived on time, and did a wonderful job. he even came in under estimate. i really look forward to using handyman matters again."
2169,"this is the 7th job i have used jeff for. jaime and rafael completed my master bedroom and bathroom in a timely manner, cleaned up and put everything as it was when they started. installation was excellent and i'm very happy with their workmanship. they also repaired a seam in another room, previously installed, and it's perfect. can't even tell where it is.  would highly recommend the crown moulding company!"
2170,"i was so impressed by myles, at j&m...he and his associate called, set up convenient times to look at, and ultimately repair the dishwasher....cleaned up extra well on the completion of the repairs...gave me hand tips on keeping the dishwasher working at it's optimum level...all in all...a stress free experience...i would definitely recommend this company to my family and friends!!!"
2171,i saw a few bad reviews about repairs from this location but sienna was so helpful and awesome! no issues at all and no questions asked! she gave me all my different options for the pants and was very kind and friendly the whole time! thank you sienna!!
2172,"new puppy who likes to chew things up - including sprinkler ""noodles"". called affordable and they got someone scheduled within a day. ramon came out and in less than an hour (after some laughing at my little ""chewy"") fixed the issue and made the offending area look like new.  he was awesome.  adding affordable sprinkler repair to my contacts list - y'all are the best!!"
2173,"after a bad experience with another company, while just trying to complete an appointment for a cost estimate, i called affordable sprinkler repair yesterday to schedule an appointment for an estimate. they came out yesterday gave me an excellent estimate and were able to repair my 5 broken sprinklers to include some pvc repair the same day for less than $250.00. 
i am very happy the first company stood me up. these guys are great!!! ask for jason, he knows his stuff."
2174,"i am so very happy with silver city.  they did a great job with communicating with me about what was going to happen next and what to expect.

i always feel weird with strangers in my house to do anything....but these guys are the best and the workers that they sent were amazing.  very professional and amazing at there job.  the repairs are done perfectly and i am very happy.

would recommend to anyone to use this company"
2175,chad successfully sourced the parts necessary to repair my modern chandelier.  he is so knowledgeable about lighting that he was able to help me based on a photograph.  five stars are not enough!
2176,ruben does a great job. i called about 3 in the afternoon and explained that i had 2 leaks in the front yard and they from the irrigation tubing. he replied within 30 min and said he would fix it today.  he got to the house about 6pm which is exactly the time quoted . he completed the repair and i no longer have a leak.  this is the second time i have used ruben with the same result. that result would be completely satisfied. i recommend ruben for any repairs.
2177,"we've used island life for years. we love them. always show up, clean and repair. our technician, jeff christopher, is excellent. highly recommend."
2178,"i needed a second opinion for a repair of my american standard a/c unit.  i had heard good things about karl and gave him a call.  even though he was very busy, he worked me into his schedule well ahead of my expectations.  karl was prompt and on time.  karl did a full evaluation of my a/c unit and recommended a repair.  karl came equipped with all the necessary equipment, parts and technical data to complete the job professionally.  it was obvious that karl really knew his stuff.  i'm all about doing the job right which is right inline with how karl does business.  karl's price for the repair was very competitive.  i would highly recommend karl meyer air conditioning & heating."
2179,"kurt is great to work with. he's punctual, has good communication skills and is a great problem solver for whatever handyman challenges you throw at him. i would definitely recommend him for your next project!"

2182,"i've used cobra twice in the past couple months and i'm very happy. my house is older 1958 and both times were situations where i had to shut the water off until repaired. cobra responded quickly and mike the tech, was professional and got the job done quickly and both times for a good price. will definitely continue to use cobra."
2183,i've had multiple repairs handled here. every time they have been thorough with the repairs.
2184,"called apex after the original repair man i called didn't show up. due to the holiday, he told me it would be a few days before he could come diagnose. estimated time was 9am to 11am, he called at 9 to say he was headed over and was able to tell me we had a small gas leak in the dryer and gave me a quote to fix, but in his honest opinion it would be easier and cost the same as buying a new dryer. 

long story short: shows up on time, tells you if it'll be more cost effective to repair or replace, doesn't cost an arm and leg."
2185,incredible buffet and great staff would definitely recommend.  worth every penny and the renovations at the palms is incredible.
2186,"i still use pure plumbing for any repair and plumbing needs, and would recommend them to anyone who wants to deal with a truly honest and great group of people!  andy and jerrod just put in a reverse osmosis system in my kitchen today, and did a fantastic job (in about 2 hours total).  they explained everything to me before they started, organized all the lines so that it's not a confusing tangle of cords, and showed me all the bells and whistles of the filtration equipment.  pure plumbing is purely wonderful!"
2187,"have used these guys on two different houses.  

a+ work!!!

they pressure wash, repair stucco, prep and paint in about 2ish days.    lines are neat and clean, zero overspray, no signs of paint cleanup in your street/gutters/drains, and no damage to plants.   when they leave all you are left with is a gorgeously painted house.  no signs whatsoever you've had contractors at your property.  

i will use over and over!!!"

2191,"if you are looking for a honest top notch a/c repair company, look no further! dave and his team are wonderful! dave takes the time to explain everything to you and is fair in pricing. jeff was the technician that replaced my unit. he did excellent work and went above and beyond. i highly recommend dave and his team, you won't regret it!"
2192,wife decided it would be a good idea to curb check my tesla model 3 rim :). checked out yelp for reviews and found rim repair. i text a pic to dave and he replied very quickly and performed the work a few days later. very happy with the work as you literally can't tell where the damage was done. highly recommend!

don't hesitate to reach out to him."
2196,"we have worked with virginia tile for years and our clients love the experience and selection. in fact they feel overwhelmed with all the wonderful tile but heather and their design staff does a fantastic job getting just the right tile for the client.  
artistic renovations always recommends vt to our clients for a great experience!"
2197,"we had pat come out this afternoon less than 24 hours after calling in a work order for a clogged sink drain. pat snaked the drain clean, and repaired a leaking p-trap that was installed by another plumber we hired that couldn't do the job correctly. pat also tightened the clean out valve that was loose, having not been tightened when repaired earlier this year. he took his time, making sure things were done correctly before leaving, giving us piece of mind--something we hadn't had with other vendors. we appreciate the work pat did and was glad for his honesty and integrity."
2198,"we had some water damage in our master bathroom and j&m was great getting the area safe and dry for the next step in the repair process. they were professional, courteous and on time! we really appreciate their work ethic and flexibility with our schedules."

2201,"eric at iphix was very helpful and informative. they're very fast, friendly, offer same day repair, and comes with a warranty. thanks guys!"
2202,"we used air for less summer 20018 in sun city summerlin due to getting a recommendation from someone we knew, a handyman.  they were very professional  and timely in every way, and a manager came and inspected at the end of the job.  then, the manager came out a week later to make sure we were satisfied. they were very neat and cleaned up after themselves.  they also explained clearly how to use the system. the cost was also very reasonable for a new trane hvac system. i trust this company."
2203,the guys who came out were very respectful. they gave me a quote and one told me his opinion on weather or not it was worth it to fix my fridge or just get a new one. i will most definitely call them again for any repairs needed.
2204,"he repaired a sprinkler head for me and did good work.  i definetly recommend him! if i ever need any more yard work done, i'll be going to him for sure"
2205,"i have an older home with many different types of materials around the windows. i called window world and bill came out to give me an estimate. his presentstion was professional and thorough. i signed the order that day! bill did not act like a typical ""sales guy"" he really believes in his product and could answer all of my questions and was not pushy in any way.  too make sure the windows were going to fit he had the installer come out and verify the measurements.  3 weeks later the windows were in! dennis the installer and his crew showed up early and installed 12 beautiful new windows in a little over half a day! bill stopped by that day to check on the install, again a thoroughly classy act!   when the windows were done the installers cleaned up so well my house looked cleaner then before they got there.  the windows are the best investment that i have put into my home. they block outside noises and i now run my  a/c at 4 to 5 degrees higher and the house feels wonderful.  bill has stopped by a few more times to check on my progress with my house renovations. this is the type of person you need to call if you are looking for new windows! he's the best!"
2206,"oh my stars. seriously guys, color me impressed!

we are currently prepping our house for sale, which can be a very stressful and busy season. we are so glad to have found elite custom painting.  danny came the same day we contacted him to give us a price quote. first impressions are important, and he was amazing. he was prompt, personable and professional. i instantly felt at ease and knew that this would be a perfect fit. after assessing our job, he emailed a very competitive quote that evening. 

once we selected elite custom painting, danny showed up right on time and got straight to work, masking and painting our rooms to look like new. he also brought on drywallers to repair damage to our walls, and returned the next day to prime and paint said patches as well as pressure wash our exterior. our home looks incredible and it only took a couple days. 

we highly recommend this company. you'd be in amazing hands!"
2207,"had the pleasure of having ramon come to my home to repair a sprinkler system having issues. ramon arrived, look at my trouble areas and was able to track the issue. had the parts on hand, and quickly fixed the problem. once he cleaned up after himself, ramon showed me the repairs and gave me a review of how the sprinkler head worked as well as how to adjust. things i never knew.. thank you.. and the charge was extremely reasonable. will use again.."
2208,"i used nld for leak detection and repair same day.  the leak was detected and repaired, i had to have some of my cool decking and underlying concrete cut away, he repaired it all, it looks the same 10 years later."
2209,snowblower repaired in promised time - staff is friendly & courteous.  will definitely recommend to family & friends
2210,"john the owner, and jose the installer were both great. i have never replaced windows before so i got 3 quotes originally. john was honest with me and didn't try to oversell or over charge me. everything was installed on time and looks great! i've still got to paint the stucco repair in a couple weeks when it cures but the repair needed was minimal due to a great instillation. would highly recommend."
2211,the inspector we had was extremely thorough and very knowledgeable. he detailed every little thing - said we had issues with the roof and when we got a roof repair estimate they said the roof would be fine  for 15-20 years. the inspector's job is to point out any potential issues which he has done.
2212,"highly recommended.  our dryer broke on friday.  tech arrived as promised on monday, knew within 30 seconds what the problem was, had the repair kit on the truck, and fixed it at a reasonable price. call them. you won't go wrong."
2213,"where to begin....this has been a rough year ..divorce needed new place, found one at valleywide and on the first day of move in the ac didn't work. this was over 4th of july weekend and 110 degrees out. i admit i was mad. the first day of move in come on.. well i called and submitted a maintenance request i really wasn't expecting a response cuz holiday weekend, but i got one and they sent an ac repairman out same day i wrote in. it turned out there's an additional switch on the wall up by the filter that has to be flipped on ...who would've known.. so ac wasn't broke after all but i did  really appreciate the quick response. thanks better days ahead!"
2214,"we had our annual plumbing inspection. the man came on time and his name is eric. he took time, effort and was professional and thorough in his report. with the house being almost 60 years old, there were a few issues. he presented them and we visually saw some of the problems. eric is a true professional and i won't let anyone else inspect from now on. he was kind, knowledgeable and went the extra mile to be considerate because our water heater needed changing and our water was off for awhile. but throughout the repairs he kept us updated and informed. the job he did was so superior to anything in this house.......including a new ac installed 2 years ago by penquin.  he is a great worker, and a very good man.
hats off to eric!! i know this company will keep him for a long time b/c he is the best we have had in the 4 year relationship."
2215,"i've have had affordable sprinkler repair fix leaks in my drip system twice. 

the first time ramone was my technician. he took his time to find the leak and explained how the coupler he was using was superior to the couplers my husband had been using. 
he made sure that he didn't leave until we were sure that there were no other leaks. 
ramone was polite, informative,and thorough. 

i recently had to have another leak repaired and i only wanted ramone. i knew he would do the job right and would not spend any more time than he needed to. 
he also walked the grounds with me before he left to make sure there were no other leaks. 

affordable sprinkler repair is as it says. it's affordable and easy to get an appointment. 

i will definitely use them again when my next leak appears. 

ask for ramone! you won't be disappointed."
2216,"i woke up yesterday morning to my ac not running. i work from home with my twin 3 year olds. i stating sending out a few yelp messages because i know how quickly my home would be heating up! nick responded very quickly and sent nathan. 
nathan is awesome! he was knowledgeable, professional and courteous. he took his time diagnosing my unit and gave us two options. one to repair and the other to replace. my husband and i decided on the replacement option. nathan made some calls and had a new ac unit on our roof by the end of the day! i am so grateful for asap plumbing & ac. will definitely recommend to friends and family!"
2217,"i am very impressed with sonoran garage doors. gabriel arrived on time, completed the repair in 45 minutes and at a very reasonable price. i also asked him for a quote on a new garage door, for when the time comes, and again he provided a very reasonable price. this company is honest, reputable and easy to deal with."
2218,valentin came out to quote us for sprinkler repair and after having another company quote an alarmingly high amount their quote was reasonable and we signed for the job on the spot. they scheduled soon thereafter and delivered as promised. we discovered additional work which needed to be done and they completed that for us the following week. i have since referred them to my brother and a coworker. great doing business with them!! honest reliable and the owner operates with great integrity.
2219,"i had a claim through american home shield to replace my hot water heater. water wise plumbing was amazing from start to finish. the communication with the office staff, coral, to the plumber bailey coming out to the house was great. he explained everything to me throughout the whole process and gave me very accurate pricing and timelines and communicated right away to the home warranty company. the repair work was fast and clean and no extra add ons or up sells. i will use them in the future for sure!"
2220,honest and reliable business owner. quick response to inquiry and next day home visit for repair. fair pricing and work comes with a warranty.
2221,"great family business....real nice folks, no add-on or last minute fees. arrived when promised, did a complete new door and lift in a few hours. i became aware of apex when a neighbor needed a last minute repair and they showed up in the evening to get it done. hard working and honest...."
2222,"sprinkler repair exceeded my expectations. i just moved to phoenix from the chicago area and know virtually nothing about irrigation and sprinkler systems. the home i moved into had broken tubing, broken/missing emitters, and a leaky valve control box. i was afraid of the price of an estimate! i selected sprinkler repair because of the great reviews on yelp. i am always a little leery of getting help with my home with a new contractor. sprinkler repair responded promptly to schedule my appointment and timothy showed up early and quickly and efficiently understood all the issues with the current system. he scouted the yard and found issues i was unaware of.  he gave me a very fast ""not to exceed"" estimate that was very reasonable. i was surprised that he was able to perform all the repairs in the one single visit. and the bill was less than the estimate, which others have mentioned in other reviews. i will recommend sprinkler repair to others."
2223,"we recently bought a remodeled house.  we bought a washer and dryer.  yahoo!!!  no dryer vent.  boo!!  i checked on yelp and response crew is perfectly named.  they responded the same day and problem solved!  
the handyman adam sent was really personable and got the job done.   now i can do some laundry.  would certainly call on them again!"
2224,"i have had such a great experience with duane!  he has been ultra responsive on the house we own (and rent out) in scottsdale.  he has performed all the work expected, and the tenants like him too.  i have recommended him to friends...that is how great he is.  i noticed some negative reviews (which surprised me), and they only thing i can say about those is that he does seem busy...but i think that speaks to how great he is that so many people want to hire him.  it is hard to find a great handyman, and duane is just that."
2225,"this company is excellent. i just bought an old house in sun city and the huge yard was a horrible mess. 5 overgrown fruit trees, 4 giant overgrown pineapple palms, weeds, dead cacti, and a completely broken irrigation system. this was a huge job. we got wuotes from other landscapers that were unreasonable. but saul gave us a very fair quote. he and his expert crew showed up on schedule. trimmed our trees, and cleaned up our yard to perfection. he repaired all of our broken irrigation and got everything working properly. we could not be happier! we will use them for all of our landscaping from now on. fabulous job guys!"
2226,"as a property manager, i know a lot of different air conditioning companies. aaa cooling is one of the most reliable and trustworthy companies i've worked with. that's why when i needed a new unit in the fall of 2012 i purchased my trane thru them. they called and reminded me about my check up and all is great. i would recommend aaa cooling specialists to anyone looking for an honest repair company."
2227,"i tried de chocolate 6x and the mango sorbet,it was good and good portion,but the place looks a little bite dirty,not very clean.....maybe need a renovation...and clean up ...."
2228,"as an owner of rental properties, i have seen the damage tenants can do to a property. it's amazing what people will do when they are disgruntled. i take pride in what my properties look like and so does cosmopolitan properties. i totally rely on debbie to maintain our properties and she keeps me informed of any repairs that need to be made. she goes to great lengths to not only get the property to a rental standard but suggest upgrades when needed. i agree with the other review that rules do need to be enforced. i would have it no other way."

2233,"they repaired three sliders in my 25 year old house on the saturday before easter. professional, clean, honest and left these doors like brand new. great people providing great value - highly recommend this company if you want to avoid buying new doors but feel like you got new ones!"
2234,"before we bought our home we hired a home inspector recommended to us by our real estate agent.  he was a little worker bee he was.  he puttered around the house, documenting everything, giving us the lowdown on where things could be improved.  at the end of the day he broke down all those things into three sections of things that had to be dealt with immediately, things that were necessary to do as preventative measures against further or future erosion and finally things that we should keep an eye on.

he was very very efficient, and spent as much time as we wanted to answer any questions.  in addition to the breakdown of upkeep on our home, he also included in his report a general amount that it would cost for each repair."
2235,"very efficient and professional,   quickly repairs and very knowledgeable of what is needed to do the job right."
2236,"professional + reliable + experienced = happy homeowner  

our drip system was not operating, dave suggested how to fix it and proceeded to explain cost/time before going forward to repair the system.  his pricing was very reasonable.  once fixed he checked the yard for improper performance of the lines and repaired any that weren't dripping.  i will definitely call them again when the  lines aren't dripping correctly."
2237,"had david fix our sprinkler system today. he explained what was wrong and gave me an estimate for repairs. he made some suggestions but i didn't feel like it was an up sell. he will be the first one i call when i'm having sprinkler issues. highly, highly recommend."
2238,"i would say the best roofing company.  javier takes pride in his work and went above and beyond making sure that everything was in pristine working order. he was quick to come out to provide a reasonable quote and setting the the repair was just a couple days later.  if you are looking for someone who will treat your roof as they were working on their own at a reasonable price, redstone is the company."
2239,"al was incredibly easy to work with.  he was quick with the communication, able to adjust & work within our time & budget constraints and most importantly, did a fabulous job on our stair renovation. they were done in less time than they estimated and left my house as clean as when they came.  we had scott as the installer and his 20+ years of experience showed.  he was quiet, pleasant and didn't mind my sick kiddos (or dogs!) popping up and down the stairs from time to time.  i only wish i had more work for them to do. al - if you read this... thank you!"

2241,"super fun ""bird zoo"" randomly located in pittsburgh. huge eagles, tiny lorikeets, and everything in between. the large exhibit was closed for renovations but there was still plenty to see. i especially enjoyed the large room with the flamingoes and plenty of other sassy birds. highly recommend a visit!"
2242,"after spending several months looking for the right design company we finally found someone who could think outside the box (not give a the same basic travertine pattern that is in almost every az home) and deliver the final product. there are many companies who will charge to design and many who will ""just wing it "" then install. we  were given a design and quote with everything in writing. we had daily meetings to explain the progress and timeline of what was to happen. our project was completed before the scheduled date. creative went above and beyond to make sure we were impressed. they even repaired the border to our neighbors  yard because it was an eyesore to the completed work on our property (at no cost to him or us.) every member of the crew was professional and respectful."
2243,i've had numerous repairs done by alley way.  they have always been prompt and professional.  i can't see myself going anywhere else.
2244,"have used this company every time we needed a repair to our garage door.  also, purchased a new garage door from them for another home we owned.

they arrive on time for appointment, very professional and efficient. cannot recommend them too strongly. you will not be disappointed."
2245,as a military family we have moved three times in the last 18 months so we rely on yelp to find quality contractors. on sunday i ended up with a big leak in our kitchen so i put in a work order with our home warranty company. on monday i got an email with the name of the company they assigned us to so of course i looked them up on yelp. unfortunately that company has all one star reviews so there was no way i was going to let that company in our house. so i looked to see who had the best reviews and spyder popped up. i gave them a call monday afternoon and they were able to send a technician to our house tuesday. not only were they able to get us an appointment for the next day they were also able to accommodate the short window i had for them to come and fix it. our technician isaac was very knowledgeable and super understanding of my situation. he was able to repair our leak very quickly and answer all of my questions. i'm so glad we went with spyder instead of the company our home warranty company assigned us.
2246,"this is a great company to do business with! i would absolutely hire them again and refer them to my friends and family (in fact i already have). kyle was professional from start to finish. best of all, he and his brother did a great job, cleaned up, and were very pleasant to be around. i had them paint a suite of rooms, a wall in my hallway, a wall in my garage, and repair a poorly patched and painted area on my kitchen ceiling. they were able to match the paint color and repair it so it looks as good as new!

i appreciate their quality, great pricing, and the overall job they did. it's difficult to find good and reliable quality when needing home repairs or upgrades, so i think kyle stands above the crowd!!"
2247,"professional, friendly staff for sure. took in my trek with a chain adjustment. quick repair, great experience."
2248,"alanna in the leasing office has been more then helpful with my move in,  so far i have had nothing but a great experience with the staff here! the renovations being done are all beautiful and the grounds are kept clean."

2250,i never thought floors could be done in a few hours but scott said he can. i had an area to cover of about 775 sq ft and it's all 1 story. scott was there really early with his crew and knocked it out! all the reviews i've read we're very positive and that's why we've decided on red mountain renovations. him and his crew worked quickly but efficiently. cleaned up afterwards and that's all there is to it. i highly recommend scott and his crew to anyone needing floors done. thanks again scott and crew!

2254,"fantastic workmanship, quick, reliable and great folks. ed is terrific to work with and our slider/door was repaired promptly and efficiently. our realtor recommended ed @ centennial because she uses them all the time in our 2000 home community.  so we figured they know their stuff, and they do. honest, reliable and great work. our sliding doors now work like a dream."
2255,caliber in tempe repaired the bumper on our new acura. we worked with ramon robles and he was fantastic! ramon took control and made sure the repair was completed to our satisfaction. we highly recommend caliber and especially working with ramon.

julie f."
2260,gina and her team were very professional and responsive. the marketing plan in comprehensive and she had a host of recommended businesses to make my needed repairs happen quickly and at a great price. i highly recommend them if you are in the market to sell your house.
2261,"this is one of those situations where i almost don't want to tell you how good duane is for purely selfish reasons....

had a big list of things that needed to be done, faucet installs, minor electrical work, vanity install, painting, and too many other things to list.  looked on yelp (as always) to see if i could find a handyman with good reviews and diamond d handyman pops up.  called immediately and asked for an estimate - the incredibly fair and detailed estimate was provided quickly so i booked a few days of his time.

wow, this guy is good.  professional and reliable, you're not going to see anything half done or sloppy, no gotchas, no cut corners, no worries at all.  i've already started making my after christmas fix it list and will be calling duane again."
2262,mark was awesome!  i called late yesterday and he was able to come the next day by noon.  he told me about the fee to inspect the fridge and if we decided to repair it it would go towards that.  the fridge was fixed and he did an excellent job.  he quoted my husband on some other repairs which we will totally call him to have done.  would recommend him!
2263,"i just bought a house using an agent from black mountain realty and couldn't be happier!

i came across bmr through word of mouth and decided to use them to purchase a house in summerlin.

the agent who helped me john walker was one of the most thorough realtor agents i've ever worked with.

he was available when i needed him and answered all my question about the homes i looked at. 

and when the time came to purchase my new home he went above and beyond and got everything done in a timely manner.

he worked well with the other agent who was selling the house and got all the small details squared away concerning small repairs and such.

in a nutshell he did everything you want and need an agent to do and did an amazing job!

if your looking for an agent that's honest, efficient  and who will get things done right then go to bmr and talk to john walker. i guarantee you won't regret it! 

2 thumbs for black mountain realty!!!"
2264,"my technician was argo. he is great, very professional and honest. he contacted me prior to his arrival, showed up on time, and did repairs in my house. after fixing stuff up, he left the area clean and neat. i would highly recommend this company for any plumbing or repairs needed for your house. thank you."
2265,"timely, efficient, honest and clean are 4 words to describe working with dave & steve.  they have been helping us baby along our old a/c unit but, of course now the heat of the summer is here and the old unit, try as we all could, did not want to go through another summer.  they and their crew took their time to correctly install a new a/c unit for me.  plus they upgraded and replaced ductwork where needed and changed the configuration from how a/c units were installed 40 years ago, to work with the new, more efficient a/c units.  they explained what they were doing, never hurrying me along even though they had more work to do each day.  what hard workers they are!  we have rental properties too and we've been fortunate to have day advance air availble to repair and maintain those units too.  this is on our highly recommended list of professionals.  call them & use them!!"
2266,"the plummer, steven, was in our home on april 25 to repair a leaky pipe in the wall. he was very pleasurable to work with, and very accommodating. he was a breath of fresh air, because other companies we've hired to do work in our new home have been extremely unreliable and unpleasant to work with. any future plumming work that we need done, we will specifically be requesting steven."
2267,"your typical american dine in restaurant. this was my first visit since they did thier renovations and it looks really nice inside. cozy with a modern feel.

i order regular (10)wings sauced with sweet chili thai sauce. the wings were perfect lightly dusty temperature wise fresh and hot and the sauce was the perfect mixture of sweet with a little kick of spice.

my waitress was very friendly and attentive."
2268,"adam repaired my parents' (very old) air conditioning unit and then put in a whole new heat/air system when nothing more could be done with it.  adam is very responsive and thorough, and was also very patient and helpful with my parents which i greatly appreciated. he did a great job and the new system works perfectly. adam has extensive knowledge and experience with heating and air conditioning units and he knows how to get the job done right - i would highly recommend him!"
2269,"jerry came out and did multiple items of work on our house.  very prompt, courteous and professional.  his work is fantastic too.  
i highly recommend him to anyone looking for great restoration/handyman work!"
2270,"i can't rave enough about jeff mullen and his action painting crew.

i've had my house painted many times since 2006 because of woodpecker problems. normally i would just call the same painter i've used in the past because it was easier than trusting someone new.

however, when jeff rang my bell and introduced his company, and then told me that i didn't have to pay until the job was completed ... i thought this was a new and refreshing concept. always with my old painter i'd have to pay him a very large deposit upfront. 

this time i decided to try action painting. what a huge difference in the quality of paint, the attention to detail and the beautiful patching of woodpecker holes. luis (one of action painting's talented employees) is amazing. his fabulous attention to detail in masking off my windows and my copper house numbers was beyond anything i've ever seen before!

i could write a book on all of the wonderful things about action painting. my house has never looked better!!!

oh, and those unsightly woodpecker holes, they are a thing of the past. after action painting repaired and painted my stucco i had a company affix microscopic wires that repel woodpeckers. it was an affordable solution to an annoying and unsightly problem i've wrestled with since 2006! 

if you are looking for a quality house painter ... look no further than action painting. i'm so glad i chose them as their work is beyond perfection! (see attached photo grid)"
2271,"2018 update:

michelle is the real deal - there is no one else i'd rather have in my corner when selling a property than michelle. this was the second property of mine that michelle has sold and the experience was the same as before - fantastic. i am an out of state seller and i was attempting to do a remodel of this home. michelle helped me from step one, overseeing many parts of the renovation. this was a difficult property to sell and took quite some time, but michelle never gave up and often reached into her deep well of experience and resources to try to give the property a boost. she hosted several open houses, facebook live events, digital home tours, drone video productions, advertisements in new media, etc. now that michelle is at launch, i know the sky's the limit for michelle. i consider michelle not only a professional that i would turn to whenever i have a property to sell, but also a personal friend with whom i hope to maintain a relationship for years to come. look no further than michelle houze if you need to sell a home in arizona."
2272,"quality repair, discount prices and  honest technicians!"

2276,"my husband and i purchased a home in red mountain ranch (mesa, az).  the home was equipped with a water filtration system and water softener.  we were not familiar with either and wanted to hire a technician to check out the systems.  we called 3 plumbers.  the first wanted to replace the softener because it appeared it was leaking (mind you he never turned it on) for $1,400.  the other two knew little about softeners or how they worked.  i finally found advantage pure flo by calling a plumbing wholesaler who sold water softeners.  without hesitation they recommended advantage pure flo.  i called them and they sent out jon the same day.  he really knew his business, repaired two leaks in the softener and completely checked out both systems.  the cost $53.50.  after discussing the arizona water, we elected to have them install a reverse osmosis system.  that was done the following monday by herman.  both these employees were super professional and you could just tell they knew exactly what they were doing and were experts in their field.  if you have water problems do not hesitate to call advantage pure flo at 480-396-0358  their website is www.advantagepureflo.com"
2277,they are much better now that they have underwent renovations. much cleaner and organized. i go early mornings and have never had to wait in line. i am glad they have both cashier and self checkout.
2278,"this company was referred to us by our electrician as our a/c had been out for 36 hours, the company the home warranty referred was not available for four more days! i called brian in desperation, advising him of our situation.  even though they were booked for the day he said he would get someone out to us today!  only minutes after i hung up with him the technician called me and said they were on their way, i nearly cried.  enrique showed up as expected and reviewed the situation.  they were very kind, courteous and professional while in our home, they advised me of the situation with photos taken of our unit.  they said they could repair it right away, and they did!!  so now, i am so thankful we called and received the recommendation because they were absolutely wonderful!  i absolutely recommend a quality hvac for their work, professionalism and compassion!  a+++"

little behind.so glad he took the time to call and keep us updated.we will definitely  use him in the future.thank you scot"
2282,great mesueum. loved reading about the nevada test site. only reason gave 4 of 5 stars was because we purchased tickets on groupon which were to include the area 51 but it's closed for renovations. last week living in vegas and i won't be able check it out when it opens in april.

top notch experience."

2295,"i completely agree with other reviewers - nps is leaps and bounds better than leslie's. i went to leslie's once when we first moved into our house 2 years ago and walked out with expensive product that did not help the original problem i went in for. never again. nps never tries to oversell and simply  tells you exactly what to do to fix your problem or chemical levels in the easiest, least expensive way. we were having trouble with our pump a few months ago and they recommended a wonderful hayward certified repair company that was just as friendly and trustworthy as the nps associates. worth the drive, even if you live closer to leslie's."
2296,"it's really hard to find an honest and reliable ac company. i've used others before that i feel took advantage of me when quoting ""necessary repairs.""  i will always call ace air first now.

2309,absolutely best company to work with. they are fast and honest. repaired my emergency situation and saved me money on repairs for the future. they came out in an hour right before the thanksgiving holiday. thanks dana!!
2310,"ed black, from environmental air, inc, repaired one of a/c units.  i have lived in the valley for 8 years and used probably 6 different a/c repair companies.  ed is by far the best.  one word sums it up: integrity.  i trust him and will hire him in the future.  ."

2312,"omg!  can you even imagine both ac units in your home going out on the same day!?  well, it happened to us.  thank goodness it wasn't 119* only 108*.  after several bad experiences with the companies that installed the units, my husband and i agreed it was time to find someone else, even though the units are still under warranty.  we were fortunate enough to find joe.  called him at approximately 6:15 p.m. on a friday.  he was finishing up a job and said he'd be there in 20 - 30 minutes, instead of the usual (if you're lucky) sometime in the next couple of days.  as promised, joe arrived in about 30 minutes, introduced himself, asked a few questions and got to work.  by 8:30 we had, cool air coming from both units and he also fixed a long standing clatter from one of the units.  the company who had installed that particular unit has been out twice to find and fix the noise.  the ""repair"" lasted about a week each time!

joe is honest, not something usually associated with ac repair, particularly here in the valley where they know you're at their mercy.  additionally, he is knowledgeable, reasonably priced, and did not tack on ""after hours fees"".  when you want a guy who can get the job done, don't look any further!"
2313,i have taken my jet ski for regular repairs and tune ups for several years to jet ski unlimited. they always make sure my equipment is thoroughly fixed and ed is a reliable person to ask for.
2314,"chris and his staff were so helpful to me this week.  they were kind, efficient and informed me (with updated emails) of the estimate, progress and completion of my repairs.  i appreciated their professionalism and would highly recommend them."
2315,"called rick hammon when our ac went out, rick was in scottsdale and said he would be here by the end of the day, he showed up around noon and had the ac fixed within an hour.  we will never call anyone but rick for our ac repairs he is honest, reliable, trustworthy and a great neighbor.  will recommend him to anyone needing an ac guy.  thanks again"

2317,raymond was quick and great to work with. glad we had such an awesome guy to repair our window. looks great!!!! thanks much!
2318,"dulcie crawford is by far the best.  we were lucky to have selected her.  whenever we need her advise or any suggestions on how to make our home look its best, she would come to see our house, in fact she came over a few times.  she knows and does business with so many people.  she recommended her handyman and he did a great job.  dulcie has the perfect way to market your home, with the technology she uses to do her business and the high knowledge and professionalism, it's no wonder she has a high volume of selling houses in such a quick amount of time.  all my husband and i have is respect and appreciation for dulcie crawford, she may have a busy schedule, but when she has time in her busy schedule, we will get a call from her personally, making sure we are updated with all her emails and if we have any questions.  we would highly recommend dulcie crawford for the time and effort she puts in marketing a home and so much more that she does to show your home for the world to see.  thank you dulcie."
2319,"i went with a group of 6 friends and had a blast! all of us were over 50...some way over with little or no experience with anything like this.

the tour was great. there is so much to see in the new downtown las vegas. fred did a great job on showing us the beautiful murals and the renovations in the area. he was also patient and attentive to make sure that everyone stayed together and got the full benefit of the tour.

i am doing it again with some out of town visitors."

2338,"i am so glad i called them for my eco repairs. we knew we needed some more insulation, etc since we had warm spots in our house. brian, our salesman was very low key, no high pressure sales. we decided to have our duct work sealed, and insulation added to our attic. everyone that came to our house was friendly and polite. they finished the repairs in a timely manner. when they came out for our final inspection, something was not sealed correctly, and we did not have to pay our balance on the repairs until they got it corrected.
the best part was our first bill. our july bill went down $170.00 from last year!!!! i am a very satisfied customer. oh, and they do all the paperwork for our srp rebates.  what more can a person ask for?"
2339,"i went to my pedestal sink and opened up the faucet and the whole hot water handle came off in my hand

i was able to shut it down but had no idea how to get this fixed. then, i remembered what a great job currey plumbing did a number of years ago when i updated the fixtures in the house

i called and they sent a great plumber to my home in the time window they promised and he was able to make an excellent repair!

i'd highly recommend currey plumbing for all your plumbing needs"
2340,"brian s, the owner, not only did an amazing job at a fantastic price, he is the most ethical businessman i've dealt with here in az. i have all travertine floors and brian and his team filled holes, sealed the edges, and polished my floor so it looks like new. he even recommended a sheen level that would be best with my dog ban unfortunate mistake happened where one of his workers scratched my dining room table. while some tradespeople might ignore it or try to cover it up brian called me right away, vowed to make it right, and paid for a professional repair at the place of my choosing. mistakes happen and i was mightily impressed by how he handled it. combine the great work he did on my floors with that level of honesty and you have a winning combination. i would highly recommend sir grout under brian s's ownership. he's the real deal!!"

2344,"zach came out a couple weeks ago to repair an issue with the garage door. he was polite and friendly, showed me exactly what he planned to do, and even made some suggestions about future maintenance for both doors. he finished the job in about an hour and at a reasonable price. he did mention that one of the motors sounded as if it was on its last legs. sure enough, two weeks later, the 20+ year old motor failed. once again, i called zach, who showed up on time, assessed the situation, and replaced the motor with one with a lifetime warranty at a decent price. i highly recommend this company!"

2349,"this is a great locally owned business! while remodeling our house we went in to work with buddy for several things. 

he helped us with our master bath vanity, and it is beautiful! the workmanship of the cabinets is way above average! we love it!

he also helped us with getting some glass cut and put in for existing cabinet doors. and although i suspect this was more of a hassle than worth it to them, they did it with a smile and were so helpful though out. 

since lv is relatively new to us, while there i asked buddy a bunch of other random questions regarding the renovation and where to buy certain things. he even helped with that!

this business is 100% committed to happy customers, and you really feel it! above and beyond what is expected!

i would recommend willbanks to my most discerning of friends, and know that they would be thanking me later!"

2351,"i hired attila and his partner rudolf to repair wall tile that was improperly installed above my kitchen cabinets.  (the original tile actually came crashing down on its own). the original tile was installed improperly on unsecured thin plywood.   

the team exceeded my expectations from start to finish.  i hired attila and rudolf because i immediately noticed their attention to detail when they stopped by to give me an estimate.  

this job required creating a secure base on to which the tile could be installed.  this design of the base took into consideration the crown molding that surrounds the area.  attila and rudolf worked extremely well together.  the area was tented off to minimize dust.  the tile work is precise and impeccable.

i am very grateful to have found attila and rudolf and plan to contact them regarding all of our future projects."
2352,our window was broken when we moved in to our house so i called ed at centennial glass to come give us an estimate. first of all i was impressed by his experience and professionalism and he was also lowest estimate. the window looks great and highly recommend him to anyone looking for window repair

2356,a few months ago we purchased an older home that we knew had many issues including heating/ac. i had 3 inspections and quotes for repairs. reliance heating & a/c also gave me mutiple options on what i could do and the positives and negatives. their pricing was very competitive and our rep daniel grimm and his team did a superb job explaining everything they were going to do. they even left the areas cleaner than they were. i highly recommend that you at least give reliance heating & a/c the opportunity to earn your business. you won't be disappointed by their professionalism.
2357,"omg!!!! after being closed for 4 years for a renovation, we arrived after they had been open only 2 weeks. our room was amazing!! i could have stayed in the room the whole trip and been happy. no detail was overlooked ! the bathrooms were amazing. the staff so wonderful, i could go on and on......."
2358,"i would highly recommend julio from maintenance masters. he's extremely knowledgeable and will do the job right. after i decided to play diy plumber, and had to turn off the water to my house for 3 days, i'm glad i called him. he was available quickly! and did an amazing job replacing my 30 year old sink plumbing, installed a new faucet, changed out my leaky garbage disposal, and even fixed the shower head that broke due to our hard water. being in the real estate business i've met a lot handymen, and julio is definitely the most knowledgeable and professional i've met. would highly recommend him if you want the job done right the first time."

systems work[ed. so when i started to have problems i had no idea who to call. luckily my son suggested calling sprinkler repair. daniel, david and aj were amazing. got things working again!  they explained everything and were very easy to work with. i would recommend sprinkler repair for all your irrigation problems!  thank you!  mary t."
2363,"it's been years since i've been to this place and the pho is still very good. i shared a large pho with my 9 year old and both of us are so stuffed!!!

the measure of a good bowl of pho is all in the soup.  the flavour or their soup is superb. 

the place is a little run down but there's a sign that they are doing renovation in july 2014 so i'm sure it will be much better."
2364,"yup, these guys are super duper good! dave, he owns it or is the lead guy. i've had vw's for the past 22 yrs and am familiar with their quirks and costs of repairs. these guys are super fair on pricing and really honest as to assessing the issues. i was recommended by a friend from my yoga class...and i will always use them to fix my vw. thanks guys!!"

2367,"payless handyman has completed several jobs for us over the last few years and we have been more than satisfied. this time we wanted a chandelier in our entry. dennis, the owner, and his crew were prompt, considerate and extremely thorough and checked their work 2-3 times, to make sure that everything was perfect. payless handyman is very professional.  i will continue to call payless handyman for any work needed in my home! highly recommended!"
2368,"i needed a large bathroom mirror removed and the wall repaired and plastered behind it.  tony & reno did a great job.  they came right away, did beautiful work, and cleaned up after.  would not hesitate to recommend him or to call him again."
2369,"nice staff, great products, and fixed my sons traxxas quickly. definitely go here for repairs or rc toys."
2370,"i've been a professional trumpet player for almost 20 years.  i'm so glad to have mike in las vegas and will surely be using him for all of my repair and maintenance needs.  even though the name says ""trumpets"" i know he's also top notch at woodwinds and pretty much everything else.  he is committed to his work and his beard.  you won't be disappointed!"
2371,"paul was very nice and was able to get my dryer working again. i told him what the problem was, he gave me a rough estimate and it was spot on. i will definitely refer him and call him again if i ever have the need for repairs."
2372,"ivan of clark heating and cooling was superb! he diagnosed the problem and fixed it as quickly as he could, delayed only by bad weather.
ivan was able to complete the repair at 1/3 the cost of our first hvac company that was recommended by our home warranty people, and that's a different story..."
2373,"wheni first walk in it was a good breathe of fresh air. new renovations, very clean very comftorable. ive been to other kim bo/po or whatever and they've all been pretty good. it seems like they are going through a whole bunch of rennovations giving their places a cleaner feel. i order the same thing everytime i goto a kim. the house special fukein noodles.

it came in about 5-8 minutes so it was fairly fast. the taste was spot on exactly how i like it. (dont forget to add some hot peppers). i always liked it because they gave 2 types of noodles. its always refreshing, never really get bored of eating just the one kind.

i managed to pay the bill around $11-12 including tips. i thing most kim po's are pretty good, but i like this one the most because its only 5 min drive from where i live lol"
2374,"i am 6'4"" and 250 lbs, but my patio door was getting the best of me. it took both hands to open and my wife really struggled with it.   it was sticking and jerking so much it was cause for a discussion to replace it.  mr. verner visited the house and in less than an hour had it opening and closing with one finger.  it is smooth as silk, better than when the house was new!  we saved a bundle and could not be happier.
thanks sw patio door repair!!"
2375,"i have had several handymen try to fix my sliding door.  it got to the point that i could barely open it.  i called dave and spoke to his wife.  they are both extremely pleasant.  dave came over the same day, as a favor since it is thanksgiving tomorrow.  he completely repaired the door at a reasonable cost.  he was so professional and a pleasure to have in my home.  i never write reviews but felt that i wanted to share how excellent his work was."
2376,"ive been going to matt at bentwood for years now, he is always busy but somehow finds time to come out and help me personally. his talents are top notch, a ""real"" gunsmith mind you not a glorified armorer. if you want your gun fixed right and fairly priced repairs he is the only place to go."
2377,"i have had the opportunity of working with this re max group and have nothing  but great things to say about them and their staff especially janis fisher. i had rented a home with my future wife and two children, shortly after doing so our air conditioner began to fail. mid summer and no air, janis was right there to help us get the problem resolved . she was ready for anything even suggesting she meet the repairmen  while we were unable to make the appointment. i only write reviews for businesses or people that truly make a difference and i believe that this group as well as janis made a difference to us. thank you janis and remax"
2378,"i was referred to jason when i was working with a home inspector and needed additional details on the roof.  we reached out to schedule an inspection on a saturday of a holiday weekend. jason personally answered my call and ensured that someone was out by tuesday morning.  ryan completed the inspection and, after emailing the report, took extra time to walk though all his findings and answer all my questions.  he did a very thorough job and provided all the details we needed. we will definitely work with payne when we schedule the minor repairs required and later, when we are ready to replace our roof."
2379,"helpful, friendly, attentive staff!  quality bumper repair!  

thanks ed! christina!"
2380,"first time using response crew, and let me say it was a great experience. from the time adam took my call, to scott coming out for the repairs, everything was top notch. extremely nice and professional. thank you response crew for fixing my homes needs. highly recommended to those reading up on this great business!"
2381,"henry is fantastic! we've used him for a variety of things with good results. our first call to him was for several projects around the house (wall patching/paint, fixing broken cabinet hinges, installing a new dishwasher, etc) he took time out of his schedule to come and look at everything to give us a formal quote.  he was honest - didn't overcharge us and in fact saved us money! he was prompt with providing a quote, scheduling and completion of the work. 

highly recommend henry and a problem solved! - they will be the first call we make for any handyman needs in the future."
2382,"i love the bloor because it has so many things!!! they play awesome non-hollywood type films, there are always political type films (cinema politica for example), then fun events like rocky horror picture show. 
the renovation a couple years ago really revamped this place and it looks really great. has a mix of an old cinema and new cinema feel. 

it's such a good cinema, their events are great, too."
2383,bill was available to come very quickly.  he was really helpful and treated me fairly. he is very knowledgeable and repaired my refrigerator and oven very quickly. i am very thankful and appreciative that we were able to find him on yelp!
2384,"i'm writing this for my dad since he isn't on yelp. silver desert handyman was extremely professional and skilled in their work. they returned our call immediately and arrived the same day. they were also incredibly accommodating working around my dad's limited work schedule. these guys were a lifesaver when we needed a handyman we could trust. if you're looking for honest and considerate people to do business with, these guys are it!"
2385,"the q is currently, in my opinion, still a great arena. the venue is well organized and constructed with a lot of attention to avoid the crowds and issues of other places. it is also amazingly well maintained given the traffic it gets, and this really surprised me at every cavs game i've been to. the concessions aren't cheap, but then again what major league sport has cheap concessions? unlike other nba arenas, even the highest seats have decent views and are well designed for a great experience. i honestly can't wait until the new renovations are made as it will take a good venue to amazing!"
2386,"rodney at lawson family plumbing was kind, efficient, and completed the job correctly and neatly.  the lawson family plumbing was easy to contact, quick to schedule and respond, and completed the jobs with professional attitude and correct fixes!
we hired them to complete plumbing repairs to a home upon tenant move out...and we would have them to our own home.
i am a real estate agent in west valley and will be recommending them to our customer/client base for sure."
2387,"last repair i got from jimmy cost less than half of what he originally quoted. 
i drive a 30 year old truck and if i keep taking it to nicks for its maintenance and repairs i just might be driving it for another 30!"
2388,the only thing that has gone right this summer. orangutan replace my air conditioner in a clean timely manner. their guys were great and helpful in making a decision on which model to buy. we love our new system. everything was done timely and without added frustration. i wish i could say that about all repair people. this was a pleasure.
2389,"i had a part on my sprinkler system that needed to be installed.  they came out immediately and took a look and gave me a quote.  unfortunately i live in an older home and had pipes that were basically falling apart as david was trying to install the new part.  he spent the rest of the day trying to get the pipes replaced so he could actually replace the part.  the communication was great, and i don't feel overcharged even though the hours were longer and more had to be done.  sprinkler repair is in my contacts and i will only use them from this day forward! thanks david!"
2390,great staff. always contacts me when i get packages. worked late to repair my hot water heater
2391,"highly recommend anyone who has any washer dryer problems contact bill first.  he will tell you honestly what he thinks even if it means that repairs,work from him are not needed."
2392,"john from surprise tech guy.. came out to my home and fixed a part that was defective in my home theater. he was booked up but came at 7am. 45 minutes later it was repaired and working perfectly. it was a miracle he had the part on hand.
thank you john for a job well done. i will definitely recommend you to all my friends. your the best..

steven s"
2393,"javier was the only company that would come out almost immediately to give me an estimate. he was very thorough in his explanation of what was wrong and how he would fix it. i scheduled to him to come out and he actually was able to get here earlier than expected and completed the job with no issues. i would highly recommend javier and redstone roofing to anyone that needs any an honest and quick roof repair.

thanks javier!"
2394,julio is a godsend - an absolute gem of a human being! i had a pipe emergency and contacted julio through yelp. he responded not even 5 minutes after my initial message and provided an initial quote that was far lower than others'. julio was able to make the repair the same afternoon. he was friendly; very detailed (a perfectionist); and turned my frown upside down with his humor...i nearly forgot i was having a bad day!
2395,"my ac unit was cycling on and off over the weekend. earliest available appointment i could make was with jason that wednesday, so had no ac on one of the hottest weeks for about four days.

jason arrived wednesday morning, as promised and did a quick inspection of my attic and ac system. he gave me a few options and i went with a quick fix, which didn't break the bank and will hold me over until the end of summer. ac repairs and replacements are expensive so i truly appreciate him being straightforward and honest with me regarding my options. 

i would have rated this review with 5 stars if they would have been able to fix my ac faster (although they did let me know that they are quite busy this time of the year and they won't be able to fix my ac sooner than wednesday).

all in all..i would recommend goettl for the good job that they've done."
2396,mitch at perfection landscape is professional and through.  he reponded quickly when i initiallly called for a sprinkler repair.  since then he has thatched our lawn and perfromed work on our irrigation system.  he is very good at explaining the issues and has a great work ethic...so hard to find!  i highly reccommend perfecton landscape.
2397,"al was fantastic!

friendly, personable and professional.

he took the time to diagnose and explain what had to be done to repair the problem in words i would understand.

he was on time and did a great job for a very fair price.

don't look any further than this company for all your sprinkler repairs.

i will only use them from now on."
2398,their renovation is really awesome. the new seats are probably the best in town and i'm driving the extra 10 minutes just to go to that theater in the future. it's also not overcrowded ever so it makes the ticket buying and concessions process very easy.  sound and picture quality is also great.
2399,just had a rock chip filled in. super fast response for a quote and very quick repair. thank you!
2400,i called these guys for a refrigerator repair.  they are very prompt in responding and the technician was at my house the next day.  the repair was done quickly and solved the issue!
2401,we are in our 2nd year of using platinum home warranty for our condo and are very glad we have them.  we've had to use them more times than i'd have hoped but they've fixed our issues and have been easy to work with.  the only downside is that you usually need them urgently and sometimes it's hard to get them out same day.  everyone has been good to work with and helpful for getting repairs done properly.
2402,"master bedroom a/c started having trouble keeping up with the recent rising temps.  they got aaron martinez to my house within 90 minutes of my call.  he was on time, professional, courteous, and saved me a bunch of money by calling the manufacturer and verifying the warranty, even though a different company sold me and installed the unit.  when he left an hour later my a/c was fully functional and i had a plan for a more extensive warranty repair."
2403,"jimmy at nicks is great.  he has worked on my acura, bmw and my husband's pick up truck.  he is fair and much less expensive than other places.  jimmy always does a full diagnostic and tries the less expensive repairs before assuming something expensive is needed.  highly recommend."
2404,"this is a relatively new business in vegas and i think the owner is trying to get good word-of-mouth for reliable, honest work. we had a burnt wire that had blacked out one third of our townhouse. jason quickly found the problem. i appreciate he did not try to up-sell me with a more complicated repair than was actually necessary."
2405,"i had ace come out for an inspection/review of my plumbing, i.e. checking for leaks, assessing water pressure, checking for proper installation of the water heater and making recommendations for improvements.  the technician, jeff, did a very thorough job and was very professional.  while he did find some minor issues, there was no hard sell for me to have them do the repair ""while i'm here"" or even an effort to urge me to do the repairs as soon as possible.  i truly appreciated the fact that it truly was an inspection and not a ploy to ""get a foot in my door"".  i have used them in the past for a/c repairs for many years and have always been highly satisfied with them.  i would definitely recommend them."
2406,been a member of the new location at yonge and 16th for 6 months. great gym with no sketchy sales tactics and no pressure for personal training. with recent renovations and recent opening means there is always something new by way of equipment. i don't do classes and minimal classes are offered. it is a great gym if you only weight train. clientele are a good mix bag but not an intimidating environment. staff are pleasant and approachable.
2407,they were great.  showed up to help me with a bathroom repair.  jeremy was very accommodating and willing to work around my schedule.
2408,"this might be the best dog park around. it has the look, user friendliness, and well-kept appeal of amador vista dog park and the size and dog friendly interaction of dos escuelas dog park. the renovations have been great with the 2 and potentially 3 dog parks. 
the rest of the park is great too. the dog friendly nature trail is fun if you like to run or walk w/ wo your dog."
2409,"i'm thankful for their product knowledge, patience and showroom . horton had the ability to help find the perfect freestanding tub that met our criteria, quality faucets and sinks that were in stock and delivered as promised which made our stressful renovation, much less stressful. 
personal follow up and follow through are rare in today's online world.

2411,"called them on a friday night for my aunts unit that was not running. he offered to come out right away, but since it was only in the 80's we agreed to have him come out the next day. he promised he would be out between 10:00 and 12:00 on saturday and he was there at 10:05. diagnosed the problem quickly and found it to be only a capacitor. her unit was down, he could have said it was anything and we would have paid it. appearance was neat and professional, arrived on time and was honest in his diagnosis and repair. i would use them again without hesitation."
2412,"i'm a realtor here in las vegas and a last minute repair before closing (in less than a week) came up on my clients property. julio was able to thoroughly explain what was need, what his costs were and how he would repair everything.  very prompt repair, very professional, and excellent work done. he communicates very well, is courteous and his work is well done. if you need any minor or even big repair work done, this is your guy.  he came through for me on a tight schedule, and delivered above expectations!"

2418,"these guys from raysco were just great! together with the mold inspector, they helped me fix the mold at my house in most cost efficient ways, saving me lots of money on unnecessary repairs. in fact, compared to other mold remediators they were able to get the same job done for at least 20% cheaper! i am very happy with the work they did and would definitely recommend raysco to anyone with mold in the house and looking for an honest and trustworthy company to fix it."

2421,i used shelby to purchase an investment home in the west valley.   she helped me line up contractors to make repairs to the home.   the closing process was simple and stress free.   when looking at investment homes it is hard to find an agent who is looking out for the clients best needs and shelby does.
2422,we just had our 30 yr old roof replaced with payne and sons and as a realtor i am very familiar with the roofing industry and i not only use them for my personal home but refer them to clients as well. their pricing is competitive and their quality is top notch. their lead time is also very quick which is important when you need repairs or replacement done as soon as possible (which most people do right?!). give jason a call...you won't find anyone better!!!
2423,"i called arizona sliding door and got an appointment for a quote for the following day. jason arrived early! he inspected my door and said it only needed a tune up which was a relief as we anticipated a much more costly repair. jason normally works in the tucson area, so i was very happy to have him repair my door. he finished the job on the spot and gave me some advice for keeping my door functioning smoothly! great job and so reasonable!"
2424,"we just bought our first house, and brittni multi was our realtor. as 22 year olds, we were completely clueless about how to go about this. at first we met with a realtor from a different agency who did not take us seriously at all. we dumped him and came to savvy because our last rental went through them. what a difference!! brittni was the best, and her partner debe was great too.

 i liked working with brittni because she was only a bit older than us, so i felt like she understood our needs perfectly. when we went to see houses, she had suggestions for renovations that appealed to our modern tastes. 

the close of the house could have gone better by no fault of anyone involved. the owners forgot to include an important key to a room that contained some shutoff valves we needed on asap. when we noticed a few days after the closing, i texted brittany and asked if she could help us. a few hours later the keys appeared on our porch! amazing. we'll be savvy customers forever now; they will never be able to get rid of us :)"
2425,"easy to communicate with. i felt they had a solid and sound understanding of what repairs i needed on my roof in february.

i can't say enough good things about mark and his team. he has all the correct licensing and knows what he is doing. when i found this very trustworthy man, i knew my search was over! call for an estimate! you will not be disappointed!"
2427,"i looked on yelp for an honest a/c guy and found luis at all around heating. what i liked was luis's bio and the fact that he does his own work versus a large company that sends out one of their employees. luis was very honest and said that my air conditioner was one of the best and there was no need for a tune up.  how honest is that?  he also gave me tips on keeping our home cooler and reducing our electric bill.  come to find out, luis is also a general contractor and does plumbing and other repairs inside the house.  we will definitely be calling luis for any repairs in the future."

2434,"arrowhead painted my house.  very happy i went with them.  the owner (mark) is very involved, not just sending a crew.  top quality materials and paint.  the best paint makes the job more expensive but worth it in the desert sun.   they even painted the roof vents!  i have not seen that on the other houses in the neighborhood when they had their house painted.
i am not a painter, but did know that preparation is the key to a quality, lasting paint job. they  did a thorough pressure wash, stucco crack repairs, and complete job cleanup.   it looks better than it did when new.  i can happily recommend arrowhead.  thanks mark."

if you're looking for a handyman, duane is your man!"
2438,"i moved into a new home with a gas fireplace and i had no idea what to do to get it going. multiple companies stated they would come take a look for about $150. i called the guys at reliable chimney sweep and they walked me through some simple things i could do on my own, low and behold it started working just fine! others would have gladly charged me $100 plus to come over and push a few buttons! i'm so grateful that i gave reliable a call, these are some really trustworthy guys with high integrity, i'll gladly go to them for any future repairs or maintenance. thanks again!"

2446,"i think you have to give the q kudos in the post-lebron era. i've gone to a handful of cavs games, and while the renovation is a bit of a nuisance now, the project sounds like it will result in an improvement. with more common areas to congregate in to enjoy the games, the atmosphere should be more enjoyable for groups...similar to progressive field. take advantage of the cheap tickets now folks. lightening may strike a second time at the pending nba draft."

2477,"at my parents' age, it's nearly impossible for them to do any sort of labor or work around their house in henderson, nv. unfortunately, my brother and i live hours away, and it's very difficult to help out when needed due to our busy work schedules. the good news is that jake and absolut handyman have been in the picture to help perform whichever work around the house they need performed. i have personally met and coordinated with jake and seen them doing the work to my parents kitchen cabinetry (yes, yelp - remove that! *annoying*). jake and his crew are very trustworthy, reliable, and the communication is superb. i highly recommend using absolut handyman."
2478,"when you see all the 5 star reviews for l&r roofing you don't need to wonder why as soon as you meet luis.  when i started getting quotes to have my roof replaced i looked at reputable companies close to me.  i got three or four quotes.  luis was the 2nd person i met and although his quote was the lowest, that wasn't the only reason i chose to go with l&r.  luis is friendly, professional and not at all a pushy sales person.  

the roof is one of the most expensive home repairs you'll have to do as a homeowner, but it is a part of home ownership.  after getting the quotes in december i realized i still needed to save up a bit more before i could move forward.  shortly after i received the quote we had a heavy rain and luis reached out to see how the roof was doing.  i let him know my new time frame to having the roof work done. i knew the quote could change, but i could not move forward at that time.  as soon as i knew i was able to move forward i reached out to luis again.  he let me know that the quote would be slightly higher due to his cost going up.  he even provided me with a letter from his supplier stating the increase.  to me this showed integrity.  he wasn't just increasing the cost because i had waited.

i was at work while the crew was replacing the roof, but luis checked in throughout the two days sending me pictures of the progress.  i didn't think i could get excited about getting a new roof, but i am.  it looks great! our curb appeal has gone way up.  next goal is to get the house painted so it goes with the brand new roof.   

i can't recommend luis and l&r roofing enough!!"

i had an issue with the installation of a water jet where the t-valve was messed up and the water started leaking. i reached out to multiple businesses but none were responsive or entertaining the repair. then lawson family plumbing came into picture and immediately scheduled an appointment for the next day for a checkup. kevin comes in on time and fixes the problem in minutes. very friendly and accommodating. i would definitely be reaching out to them for any plumbing issues."

2501,"i had an excellent experience with pink plumbing. after a very high water bill, we knew we had a leak but we're unsure of the location.  pink had a plumber at my house just a few hours after we called them, and found the leak immediately. the repairs were fairly priced and the quality of work was excellent. 

we were worried that the repairs did not hold because of some flooding in the area, but we weren't sure if the pipe had burst or if it was storm runoff. pink sent someone out the next morning to verify their repairs and confirmed that it was rainwater.

i highly recommend this company for all of your plumbing needs."
2502,"i explained to paul the issue with my dryer and he was able to provide an accurate estimate for the repair. he was able to make the repairs in a short period of time. my dryer is working like new.  thanks, paul!"
2503,"we recently had the worst monsoon winds we've in almost 3 years living in this house. i read other reviews on yelp, called & spoke with brian (owner) the next morning after i noticed our side porch had been severely damaged. brian got me a quote by that evening that seemed reasonable for the roof replacement since the damage was beyond repair. brian was able to schedule me in under a week & his crew arrived on-time 6:00 am & we're friendly & professional. they finished within a couple of hours. i am very satisfied with this company & would absolutely recommend to anybody in the area for any roofing needs"

2507,"i had several sinks where the faucets were leaking and had a leak with the pipes underneath due to a shabby, convoluted job from the previous owner.  this made the job even more difficult and challenging.  tyler and jordan came to our home, explained what they needed to do as well as the proper hardware, piping, etc,  they were able to install and fix everything quickly and efficiently.  after they finished everything they showed us all their repairs, answered all of our questions, and left a clean work area.  high quality work, great attitudes, and dependable individuals.  i highly recommend plumbing kings and their knowledgeable, personable staff without any hesitation."
2508,alan arrived promptly today and worked through a list of repairs we needed as part of the sale of our home. the work was excellent. we recommend the response crew and will use them again if the need arises.

2521,"no need to look any further!!  this company does a wonderful job.  very honest, quality work and communicates with you respecting your time.  we had a minor repair done and decided to put in a new opener because one had failed on a different door.  quinn was prepared with a replacement unit on his truck.  he moved our existing opener to the door that had failed and put in the new one on our main door.  he was efficient and his price was very fair.  very nice people to work with and yes i would call them again.  i will refer them to all my friends!  just call them.  you won't be sorry."
2522,"while i generally prefer moon nursery with a larger variety of plants available at each of its locations in the last vegas metropolitan area for the majority of my gardening/landscaping needs, star nursery is best for resolving any issues with my irrigation/sprinkler system.

if star nursery doesn't have the part i'm looking for to make needed repairs/modifications, then it's unlikely that anyone else in las vegas will have it either and it will usually need to be ordered online. however, that rarely happens.

star nursery does have more locations around town (about twice as many) than moon nursery overall, but more often than not the latter business is where i purchase everything green and beautiful."
2523,"charles and team were stellar. exceptionally professional and performed a meticulous job on our home. they power wash, repair stucco, fill cracks and use quality dunn edward paint. no overspray, no mess. nice job guys, thank you!! highly recommend."
2524,vladimir was friendly and professional. he was thorough in his explanation of the issue with my fridge and patiently explained the steps needed to fix it. he gave my fridge a temporary fix so it could function while we waited for the part to delivery. he was very timely and communicated when the part came in and made the best effort to fix it as quickly as possible. i would definitely reuse him for future repairs.
2525,i had my fireplace cleaned and the firebox repaired.   the technician was very polite and professional.  i would recommend chim chim cheroo.

thanks for driving from tempe to mesa to meet with me. i love the idea of her consumer guardian plan. can you believe for 15.99 a month her clients can have an attorney block debt collector calls? wow!!"
2527,"ed and frank came in to refinish my door and repair a little bit. they did a fantastic job. they were very easy to work with. it took a long time for them to sand , stain and then polish just because they were so detailed and letting it to dry after staining and polishing. 
i would highly recommend them. will hire again in future."
2528,"home inspection on a house for sale found a couple of issues. a&e came out on time to inspect, provided an estimate for repairs and took all steps necessary to do the job once they received authorization. they even certified the repairs for two years at a reasonable cost to satisfy the mortgage company. on time and got the work done!"
2529,"wow!  showed up on time, incredibly professional and adaptable (i have two special needs kids) and the work was top notch.  i had a ton of small but challenging jobs.  angel and his co-worker found a way to get it all done in a short amount of time in an excellent manner.  for sure me go-to for all my handyman needs!"
2530,"i have used a&e roofing for all my roofing needs.  because i am a real estate agent, i come across roofing problems all the time.  a&e has repaired small problems, inspected roofs and provided all new roofs.  they are the only company i use, and i refer them to whomever asks."

2533,"silver desert handy man...specifically rudy, did an excellent job for me!  rudy showed up on time and ready to work. rudy knows that time is money and i had 2 different project for him to work and he worked on them both at the same time.  #1) i had to fix a hole in my dry wall after having to run speaker wires in my house.  2) i wanted to install a portable a/c unit in a room in my house that is always hotter than the rest of the house.  rudy could have started #2 first and finished #1 and left, but to make sure the job was done right. that is, to make sure the area matched the rest of the wall you need to make sure it dries first and then knock off the dry wall treatment.  it just can't be done correctly if you don't wait for it to dry. frankly, i wasn't aware of this until after the job was done and rudy didn't mention it until later, but i mention it because i want everyone to know in ""angie's list land"" rudy has integrity and does the right job the first time!
rudy works fast and doesn't rest between jobs. he explains what he is doing while he is doing it and doing a good job seems to be a part of his dna.  don't be shocked if you hear an eastern block accent when you talk to rudy (found out it is really rudolf and he is czech),  his accent tells me rudy doesn't solve problems by just buying a new one, he is a person that knows how to make things work and work well, with what is on hand...to me this is a valuable trait in a handyman!"
2534,"my local handyman referred this plumbing outfit for a job. i couldn't write this positive review fast enough. ben, the plumber that showed up assessed my situation which has been troubling me for months remedied the problem and the pricing was extremely affordable as the name suggests! it's great having a great plumber to turn to when in need."
2535,i had the pleasure of working with this hard-working young business owner if you're looking for a quick repair in the comfortability of your own home i assure you this is the way to go i had an awesome experience and you're well too
2536,goettle ac is my new go to company for repairs and maintenance. my ac was giving me problems on a sunday and they were out to my house within a couple of hours. my repairman chris was friendly and knowledgeable. i really appreciate the time he took to explain what was going on with the unit.  i also received two free gifts!
2537,"usually when i need my water heater repaired its hard to find the right people to fix it properly. i was referred to this place and they are great. travis made me feel comfortable and answered all my questions concerning the water heater so hopefully next time it happens i could maybe fix it myself. he was very helpful and knew what he was doing. while he was fixing the problem he kindly guided me through the steps on why it wasn't working. it didn't take long, he came fixed it and was on his way. i will most definitely recommend this place to my friends. thanks travis."
2538,i moved into bloom 24 2 months ago and i love it! james the manager has really stepped up to ensure i'm happy. maintenance is a little slow but they are balancing between renovations and repairs so jose is kept hopping. with these 120 degree days i'm loving that my rent includes utilities

2540,"i'd highly recommend gps remodeling. recently had leaking on the inside of the house after 2 valleys near our front entrance failed (was told from numerous companies this was very common with valley homes). while their were a couple communication issues initially, the job was quoted and came in similar or just under others. on top of that, george worked with me and gave me an additional discount which sent his bid well lower than the others. work performed was quick and seems to have solved our leaks as it's rained twice since and all appears dry. i can't speak on other work gps performs but if you're needing a roof repair, look no further."
2541,"the taylormade golf experience has taken over the old callaway golf center. major renovations are underway and good deal can be found on some of the remaining callaway equipment. most of the staff from callaway remain. one change i like is being able to walk directly onto the grounds without having to hand your clubs over to pickup after you walk through the clubhouse. i driving range has great views and the course is a 9 hole par 3 setup, but is fun if you want a quick round."
2542,"right way roofing was fantastic! kevin came out and inspected our roof and provided us affordable options for repairs. he was able to seal the leaks right on the spot as a temporary repair, which was great! he was very friendly and we love supporting local, family owned businesses. thanks for helping keep us dry kevin & right way!"

2544,"had a small roof leak, asked my a/c company if they could repair it or recommend someone. they inspected the roof found the source of the leak and referred me to pete from orangutan.  pete was very friendly and helpful, showed up promptly on time and gave me a reasonable estimate. 
on the day we agreed to, he again arrived exactly on time and not only preformed what he said he would do but additionally sealed around the chimney and skylight which was not part of the estimate. 
he answered all my questions and gave me a two year warranty.  i was very impressed and would definitely use them again for any roof issue."
2545,"we had jay and pavlo from apex window werks repair some of our windows last saturday. they showed up on time, were professional, friendly and did a great job.

2551,"we just pulled in to vegas a few hours ago, ready and excited to exhibit at our first comic con and within the first twenty minutes i had broken our brand new banner that we brought from la and hadn't even used yet. we saw that these guys had great reviews so drove the 20 min across vegas to pop in and see if they could help us repair it. 

they repaired our banner at no charge!!!!

honestly, i wish we lived in vegas just so we could work with these guys more often. 

great job!"
2552,"excellent experience from start to finish! i have never had to deal with roof repairs or roofing contractors before. the owner brian at vhb roofing was very professional, knowledgeable, and honest. it was a pleasure doing business with them. thank you!"
2553,troy was amazing!!!  troy has a great personality and was so professional.  he explained every step. gave us clear directions on how to stage our home and even recommended a fantastic handyman to help us.  with his guidance we had multiple offers and were under contract within days.  we could not imagine going through this process with any other realtor!!!   troy is the best!!  highly recommend him to anyone needing to sell their home.

2555,"i met a technician coming out of home depot as he was loading up his truck. i called them up to install our doggie door in the wall of our new home.  greg the technician came out and  did a great job. my wife is happy, my dogs are happy. me not so happy. the programming for the remote access to the door is puzzling. my own doing.  we will be giving response crew a call for some other handyman projects that we have coming up. thank you
craig & kathy"
2556,"this company is amazing, we had a leak in our kitchen and had several companies come to give us a quote on the repairs. after being told something different by each one and feeling hopeless we were referred to erx by a co-worker who has done work with them before. the crew came out that same day and had everything done in a few hours. the crew was professional, hard working and took time to answer all my questions. they have made this process a lot easier to deal with. if you choose to go with this company you will not be sorry."
2557,"well paul 50 yr old maytag is still going stronger than ever.
was just reading through some of the reviews and was amazed how many of them you respond to.  don't know where you find the time to do that with all the repairs you have to do.
all i can say is thank thank you again for the wonderful repair job you did for old maytag"
2558,would use this company again for sure. henry was on time and professional. had an issue with our dishwasher and he was able to repair it.
2559,we recently purchased a home here in las vegas and needed some roof repairs. rhino roofing was quick and easy. called and the technician came when scheduled and wrote an estimate for the next day. repairs were made promptly and correctly. i highly recommend this company for your roofing repairs.
2560,"i've had at least four dealings with this garage, and they have all been reasonable and very fair. to play it safe, i called around and asked for quotes at a number of places before one of the repairs, and they were also the least expensive. i feel this group is trustworthy and doesn't add on extra repairs (which seems to be very common nowadays). 

a very, very good garage."
2561,"josh and his crew are great!  i hired them to do our grout repair and sealing even though the quote was more.  from the reviews, i chose to pay more for a better result and i definitely made the right decision.  our floors look wonderful."
2562,"maintenance masters was contacted 5/31. quote given & time was set.
call was made 20 minutes before arrival.  reviewed job & repairs were made in a prompt and efficient manner. his initial quote was very fair & he stuck with it. i found julio and company to be very professional. i will use him again & suggest him to others."

2568,"i hired silver desert handyman to repair wall tile that was improperly installed above my kitchen cabinets.  (the original tile actually came crashing down on its own). the original tile was installed improperly on unsecured thin plywood.   

silver desert handyman exceeded my expectations from start to finish.  i hired rudolf because i immediately noticed his attention to detail when he stopped by to give me an estimate.  

this job required creating a secure base on to which the tile could be installed.  the design of the base took into consideration the crown molding that surrounds the area.  rudolf and his partner attila worked extremely well together.  the area was tented off to minimize dust.  the tile work is precise and impeccable. 

i am very grateful to have found silver desert handyman and plan to contact them regarding all of our future projects."
2569,had an issue with canceling my membership. sebastian reached out to me and solved my issue with my cancellation process.  my experience at this location was alright only because renovations to the locker rooms and constant construction on my route to the gym made it unpleasant. a few staff members seemed uninterested in working there. other than that this gym has tons of equipment and in my opinion has great value for what they charge.  i'm not sure if they have one or not but i would have liked some source of social media (facebook) to keep me up to date on their events.
2570,had garage door repair done today and it was done quickly and efficiently.  definitely a very reputable business ~ first time to my home.  ryan was great.  he certainly knows the business and garage doors.  i had to get to work so he worked quickly to make the repairs and did it all within a reasonable time. he was courteous and called to say he was on his way.  i will definitely call on apex garage door repair again and request ryan.  great company!!

2575,"i have known simon for a few years and have always referred him to anyone that i know that needed electrical work.  this time we needed him on our personal home.  i wanted the old can lights replaced with recessed lights in the kitchen and then added additional recessed lighting in the family room and formal living room..his attention to detail is awesome.  there was very little drywall damage, and what little there was he repaired and painted (we had the paint match from when we had painted the interior a few years ago).  everything was cleaned up when he left and you really couldn't tell that he was ever there.  he has an assistant ""alex"" who was very trustworthy and also very capable.  i would not hesitate to refer them in the future, it's hard to find good contractors in the valley but they are one of the best.!"
2576,"i thought for sure i'd have to replace my sliding door and was not looking forward to that expense. it had been getting worse over the 20+years i've been in the house and it was way past time to do something about it. after looking into a repair opinion, i found arizona sliding door, saw great reviews and requested a quote. heather gave me an estimate r range based on work that might be done and fully explained the work. we set the appointment, dave was right on time, and got my door working better than new. no hidden costs or surprises. highly recommend. thank you, heather and dave!"
2577,"our a/c stopped blowing air one night. with 3 small kids in the house we needed repairs done fast. we called on time air conditioner after reading reviews on angie's list. greg came out at 9pm and was very nice and professional. he quickly got on the roof and diagnosed the problem right away, bad capacitors. he had the replacement parts on his truck and fixed them quickly, it took about an hour. the price was much better than i expected. i would definitely use them again."
2578,from the time i called 5 star responded almost immediately. enrique called to let me know he was on his way and would be at my home in 10 minutes and he was. he examined my hot water heater and determined what was wrong and immediately went to work and repaired it. he is definitely a certified technician and was very pleasant to deal with and i am thoroughly satisfied with his work. he represents 5 star in a very friendly and professional manner. he had the necessary part with him and now i have hot water thanks to enrique.
2579,"scott is wonderful he shows up on time and walks you through all the repairs needed then he fixed our ""self install"" of the nest system that did not go well. we are now enjoying the ease of use for our nest and of course we love the air conditioning that the repair has provided. scott knows what he's doing and works very hard to be your     ""go-to"" electrician which he has become for us."
2580,"i'm so glad my daughter recommended stanley's. they deal with you fair and square, telling you upfront exactly what is wrong and how much it will cost. and they don't try to talk you into repairs you really don't need. plus the place is very neat and clean.  this is the second time i've used them since we moved to phoenix last august. they will definitely be my go to garage for problems large and small"

2585,"i had a technician damage one of my customers baseboard and tile grout. i called jeremy to see if they would be able to fix the damage. though the job was a bit outside his area of operation, he agreed to take on the project. he showed up on time and did a wonderful job. his prices are very reasonable as well. my customer is happy and now i know who to call for future repair needs. i highly recommend jeremy."
2586,my ac quit working on a late sat night and i sent an email to describe the problem.  on sunday i got a response with info for monday.  first thing monday i had an app with the estimate for repairs.  they arrived exactly on time and fixed the problem in an hour for the exact estimate price.  ac now works perfectly!

i will be using his company again."
2590,"focus plumbing is my go-to plumbing company. jim, is the technician who was able to diagnose the problem with the hot water side of my master bathroom tub, when two other loan plumbing companies could not. now, we finally get to enjoy one of the best features in the house. jim took the time to diagnose the problem, order the appropriate parts, then follow up to see that the repair was completed. thanks to focus and jim for following through, where the other companies were just looking for a quick, easy fix, and off to the next job. plus, jim put his booties on when he entered my home, and took them off and on as he entered and exited...a real plus in my book."
2591,i'm so glad i signed up with this company! my credit has never looked this good. i was always hesitant to get my credit repaired because i thought it would take years to fix but i have seen amazing results in just 2 months! thank you thank you
2592,"scott was amazing! i emailed pics of our repair issue after about 7pm on thursday night. shortly thereafter scott replied with a quote and the next morning scott was at our house. a man of few words, scott was very efficient. in and out, with stellar workmanship."
2593,"don't even think of going anywhere else for your dyson repair. friendly, helpful, extremely knowledgeable. practically rebuilt our old dyson and charged very little. we will definitely go here for our next vacuum to support this wonderful business."
2594,"david and his family run this business and are super friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. i dropped off my truck to have it repaired and was having trouble finding a ride to get my truck picked up and they offered to pick me up from where i was. super helpful and i really appreciated it."
2595,"fantastic.  i requested quotes from several roofing companies.  i only needed repairs, but every other company wanted to sell me a new roof instead of making repairs.

alex not only did the repairs, but did more than he quoted for and was very reasonable.  he came out to check the work and meet me in person to discuss the work completed.

we sold the house, had an inspection and the roof was perfect.

i will use ab roofing from now on. excellent!"
2596,"if you need some dry wall and paint repair call this company!
they came at the time we scheduled and did a great job and the price was even less $$$ than others.
i had a  2 rooms painted and custom closet built . definitely i'll use them again in the future.
high recommend!!!!"
2597,"ken came out today to help with a leak we had on our outside spigot. he was extremely helpful. he explained what the problem was and why the fix would, in fact, fix it.  

he also recommended other repairs to make next so that we can get everything up to par around the house. 

great experience with bumble bee and ken!"
2598,the gentleman that came to my house were beyond qualified for the job!! they were very friendly and polite and worked quickly. not only did they repair what i had called about but also took on other jobs while here! their work is pure quality and  i would highly recommend their expertise to anyone in need of home repairs!!
2599,"i'm adding my 2-cents: legends garage door was great! they came out on time, repaired my garage door in less than half an hour and charged me what they had quoted for the job. and now my door opens again. how could i ask for more?"
2600,i don't know what i would do without out brandy and her team! my tenants have been in my house for over 3 years and couldn't be happier! they keep me up to date and whenever there is a repair to my home they are on it! they are always positive and a joy to talk to!  lorraine is been a wonderful help to me with my home and makes me feel at ease!  thanks again to brandy and her pm team!
2601,"one of the best places i recently ate! big portions, very delicious and the staff is very nice especilly kro, who always prepairs everything fast and with smile and exactly as you want it. recommend!"
2602,"these guys are great! on time, professional, and priced great. jared is especially good and takes the time to explain what is going on in terms that are understandable. if you need a/c repair, call them. you will be glad you did!"
2603,"scott did a good job in some drywall repair, very responsive to emails and request."
2604,"once again had to have arturo come out. the downstairs ceiling was leaking due to a problem in the overhead master bathroom. he had to cut through the ceiling,  & fix the problem. a few scheduling problems (mostly mine), but arturo is always easy to work with, so got it done. i was worried about the ceiling repair, but he had me call juan in a million, and they not only did a seamless repair, but found an exact paint match for a 20 year old ceiling. i highly recommend arturo, and will follow his suggestions for any other contractors."
2605,"this guy is the best, it's unreal.  he's given life to my all my boots. had a rip on top of my boots from wear and he repaired it to the point that i can't remember where it was torn. re-soled all my boots. he is a miracle worker."
2606,"used the handyman connection today for the first time and was very impressed. i read some other reviews where people had complaints, but they clearly didn't have rob. rob was punctual (early actually but he called to make sure it wouldn't inconvenience us), professional and did the job for less than he originally quoted because he was able to finish sooner than expected. the drywall work he did was top notch and i would definitely call again as long as rob was available."
2607,"we have never  had a meal that we did not enjoy. it is affordable for families and we love their salsa.i see a
 fence around the one in scottsdale and we hope it is only a renovation, not closure."
2608,they have an amazing repair department!
2609,"holy freakin' cow!! why did i not call sooner?? i had (past tense) the most stubborn, heavy, huge, ridiculous patio ""sliding"" door that was great for security . . . no one could get in or out!! tj was out this morning and in less than an hour, made my door slide open with ease. amazing!! i'm sure it was just an ordinary kind of repair for him but he has made my life so much easier by being able to access my yard through a door that actually slides open . . . as it was meant to do.

glass guru was prompt in their response and arranged a day and time that worked well with my crazy schedule. i cannot thank you all enough for the help!"
2610,"i recently was in need of a garage door repair. i was really hoping that i wouldn't have to purchase a whole new one since the hardware and opener were in great shape. after looking on yelp, i called legends garage door and i'm so happy that i did. cory came out the next day and said he could replace just the panels of the garage door which would save me considerable money. cory was awesome!! he was professional and very friendly and there was absolutely no high pressure to upgrade to a more expensive door. he arrived early on the day promised and was finished within 45 minutes! i was so thankful i called them and i highly recommend them!!"
2611,"excellent work, very happy of the professionalism and the quality of its work. thank you very much for the very effective repair done on my air conditioning system."
2612,had called a couple other companies when my ac went out today and they couldn't get anyone out until tomorrow evening.  luis was able to squeeze me in just before he went home for the day today!  super quick repair and very friendly!  air conditioning never felt so good!
2613,"i would definitely recommend handyman xtreme. i had a few projects that needed to be fixed around the house. i called, sent photos of what needed to be done and they sent me an email with a estimate.  kurt was out the following week on time, prepared with the material needed and extremely professional."
2614,left midas muffler up the street with a qoute for $918 to fix my vw jettas muffler..sitting in waiting room at speedy getting the repair done for $60..incredible
2615,steve at atomic is not only on time but very thorough on the repairs needed. i have recommended him and will continue to do so!
2616,"this place has been amazing!! i came here for both of my daughters ipad repairs and they got it done quickly even though i wasn't in a rush. super professional, clean, and helpful establishment!"
2617,"donna and her team painted walls, cabinets and doors of my house. they were all professional painters and did a great job. donna was kind enough to give us very helpful comments regarding other types of renovations we needed to do. i strongly recommend her."
2618,appointment was set quickly.  repair technicans replaced the control unit right away without many questions.
2619,"have worked with this company for several years. glen is who you need to talk to. knows everything about...well everything re: loans, loan modifications and credit repair. he will give it to you straight and not put you into any kind of loan program that isn't right for you."
2620,all of the inspectors at king home inspections are amazing. the inspectors go above and beyond to not only show what repairs the house may need but to educate the buyer on the house they are buying. all of the inspectors are very consistent and you receive your inspection report promptly.
2621,"i  had a call this morning from kitty, and they have agreed to refund a good portion of our repair bill.  thank you so much for the call and concern.  i will now recommend w j maloney plumbing as an a-1 company."
2622,super happy to have found a handyman who is willing to whatever is necessary to make the customer happy! we appreciate this and you now have a lifetime diligent customer. i highly recommend them!
2623,"had them come out twice to look at my refigerator that has been acting.  the techinician scott was very helpful and didn't try to fix something that ""may"" have been the problem just to make money.  i would highly reccommend and will always call them first when a repair in needed!"
2624,they were able to come out the same day to get a light working and install an outlet on our patio. i had called all over for someone to be able to come that day and had been striking out left and right. they were very professional and quick to get the repair done.
2625,i don't understand. they closed this starbucks for all of these renovations which were not needed and now they do not use the camera so u can see them when you order. i mean they can see you and u can see them but they never turn it on. what is the sense to spend all of that money to install a system such as this and it is never utilized? they could've taken that money and gave it to a poor community or pay their workers more or lower the price of their expensive coffee. all i am saying is that if you are going to spend the money use what you spent it on!!
2626,"i love this mall, i've come here ever since i was a kid. there have been a lot of renovations to this mall. i especially like the fact that the mall is so big and you can also get on the subway to go downtown from there.

in addition, there's a bunch of parking and restaurants in and around the mall. jack astors, milestones, they even have a movie theatre inside the mall.

one of my favourite malls in the gta, no doubt!

4/5."
2627,quick response at a fair price for extremely professional work (which they stand by) what more could a person needing repairs possibly ask for?
2628,"i have been going to roy's for the last 7 years and through several repairs they have demonstrated honesty, integrity and and great workmanship. they only use higher end parts but they will not up-sell you or tell you that you need something you don't. highly recommend!!!"
2629,"purrfect pet doors repaired and replaced a pet door installed by a prior owner. it had challenges, but eddie quickly and professionally handled the job. i received exactly what i wanted and you cannot even see any sign of the prior owners mess. i am extremely happy with the great job performed."
2630,"i have been wanting to make my home more energy efficient. i called  dan with for energy & he came & did a evaluation to figure out what i what i could do to save money & be more comfortable in my home. i qualified for rebates with srp to help pay for the work that was done. they added insulation, sealed my attic & repaired duct work. i immediately noticed the difference & my home is more comfortable. i would highly recommend getting an evaluation to find out how you can save money &  have a more comfortable home."
2631,"kevin was very thorough, flexible & reasonable in his rates.  we asked for a one-year warranty inspection on our new home.  he found many things (major & minor) that needed to be repaired by the builder.  after the work was done, we called to ask for a re-inspection of areas we could not see by ourselves (attic & roof repairs).  he came in a short lead time to re-inspect these areas & the re-inspection fee was nominal.  i would highly recommend kevin if you need a home inspection!"
2632,"scott was very responsive and got me in quickly. he did great work, very clean and professional. it looks like original work and completely blended with what was already there. you cant even tell that it was damaged.  he explained what the next steps would be for the drywall and even gave me some tips on how to fix a tile that was right below the repair.  will definitely be calling him again when i need more work done."
2633,brought my johnston & murphy's in for repair.  they used top quality european style leather soles that look great.  $60 total and i'm good to go!
2634,"i am so impressed with naylor solar specialist.  terry came out to give us a free estimate to repair our solar panels.  when he called to make the appointment he was at the door within 10 minutes on the same day!!  

we had another solar company out and they charged us $165.00 which they stated would apply to the repairs.  the estimate they gave us was over $1,300.00.

terry repaired our solar (under a half hour)  even though it was not his product on our roof.   naylor solar specialist's are extremely reasonable and extremely honest!!!  

my only disappointment is the fact i did not contact naylor solar specialist first."
2635,"josh promptly answered my inquiry, despite the late hours i made it. scheduled and made his next morning  appointment and performed a free of charge assessment of a failed hvac unit. maintained good communication step by step and gained my confidence with his promptitude and precise technical explanations. finding multiple problems with it, he advised and would commit only to replacing the unit, a cost too big for me since the homewarranty company is supposed to cover the repair. that is the only reason i didn't go along with it but will surely use this contractor in the future.
thanks again josh for your time in this busy time of year for you.
gratefully,
ei"
2636,honest and they explained everything. told me when was a priority and what could wait . worked with me to budget my repairs. would definitely recommend to anyone.
2637,"my home warranty policy sent these guys out to my house to look at my hvac unit outside since the motor kept overheating.  jeff was great.  he was straight forward, no bullshit, to the point, and very honest.  my repair window was between 6-8am and he showed up promptly at 6am, diagnosed the problem, got approval from the home warranty company, made the repairs and was out by about 6:45ish.

if you're looking for someone to sugar coat things, you probably don't want blue ox but if you need someone to tell you like it is and cut right to the problem to get it solved in a timely manner, these are your guys.  i have already recommended these guys to a close friend of mine within minutes of them leaving and would recommend them again.

life's tough, phoenix is hot, and blue ox fixes your air conditioning."
2638,the owner here is super friendly and was quick to follow up when my friend had an issue. i'm looking forward to their re-opening and new renovations.
2639,"these guys have done work for me in the past. very professional and quality work. they show up as scheduled, and got the job done!  my lighting system is old and in constant need of minor repairs. budget is always a concern for me, and they are very sensitive to that. 

every other company that has come out isn't interested in repair, just wanting to sell me a whole new system."
2640,"this guys know their stuff! they've saved me thousands in potential repairs had i not hired them to look over the house i was interested to buy! if you are looking for professionals to do a proper home inspection,  look no further!  highly recommended!"
2641,"the best, and the only place for your guitar repair and or parts! i took my gibson explorer to these guys when it was in about 7 pieces. about 6 weeks later (the glue takes a long time to dry), when i picked it up i couldn't believe how perfect it looked! they have set up about 7 guitars for me, with and without floyd rose tremelos, and the action, sound, whammy bars, etc., have been perfect every time. if you need some weird, small part for your guitar, this is the only place in phx where you'll find this kind of thing. do not take your guitar anywhere else for repair!!!! very friendly and professional staff as well!"
2642,honest and they explained everything. told me when was a priority and what could wait . worked with me to budget my repairs. would definitely recommend to anyone.
2643,"scott did a fantastic job fixing our drywall after a water pipe leak caused damage to the ceiling and wall in our dining area.  his estimate from the photos we emailed was way less than two others we'd gotten, and he also was able to do the job before the appointment we'd arranged.  he replaced the drywall and textured the area, perfectly matching the rest of the ceiling and walls.  it looks better than new!   he was extremely professional, very knowledgeable, paid attention to detail, and was always prompt.  not only that, he cleaned up everything before he left.. 1st choice drywall repair has our highest recommendation!"
2644,"busted knuckle was literally the angel i needed! my husband and i were on vacation trying to drive to arizona when, while trying to get to our park, bucked our trailer right off our hitch just off of boulder highway at 10 on a saturday night. we were able to get the trailer rehitched and limp it to our park but our vacation was looking bleak. we called busted knuckle at midnight and said they would come out first thing the next morning. they were there early and assessed our issues quick and were able to fix us up even quicker. no need to delay in vegas to wait for a couple of non-essential parts they said (which probably lost them money - seriously who is that awesome) and we were on our way with the essentials repaired. i seriously can never thank them enough, they saved our vacation!"
2645,"i may have already reviewed jeremy, but just in case not, he's really extraordinary. he's worth all 5 stars and then some. he does an excellent job, shows up on time and is very professional. while you might have to wait awhile to see him (the good ones like him are busy,) he's worth the wait. on his first job with us, in our new home, i had a list of things for him to do a mile long. and to complicate things, we were still in the sf bay area, when jeremy was here in the valley doing the work. but he got everything 100% right...and then some. we've since used him again and again and he's now are forever, handyman."
2646,"i was really impressed with vahn. i had a house under contract and contracted him to do the inspection. he did a very thorough inspection and found a number of major issues that were not obvious. he clearly knows his stuff, and was happy to explain things to me while i tagged along on his inspection. after getting contractors to give me estimates for the major defects he discovered, i found that it represented 60k in unexpected costs and disruptive repairs, so we pulled our offer. getting a good home inspection is essential when buying houses, especially in old houses at toronto prices! the first house i bought my home inspector missed a lot of defects and the report was sloppy. vahn's report was very clear with tons of photos and diagrams indicating how the problem should be corrected. 

i got the thermal scanning package, and while we didn't find any issues in my opinion it was worth it for the peace of mind."
2647,"working with canyon desert painting was the best house painting experience i could have hoped for. don was direct, honest, professional and prompt. my house looks great! and don completed the job a day early and did exactly what he said he was going to do. he also did some extensive repairs to the patio ceiling, and it looks great. highly recommended."
2648,"the bronson brothers are awesome! mark and john have been helping out with my basses for a few years now. every time i go in, it turns into a great learning experience and my instruments are returned sounding better than ever. if you're looking to get any guitar repairs or setups, definitely come here!"
2649,"fair company that is there when i need them. they are on time, fair and thorough. i trust them with my ac and my plumbing repairs.   techs are all friendly and honest."
2650,"i had correspondence with ed about a few pieces of furniture i was looking to have repaired. he was very knowledgeable and truthful. two qualities i appreciate greatly. he was so helpful that he even recommended another company to assist with some patio furniture that needs sprucing up. all in all, ed is extremely personable and professional and i can't wait to employ his help with my old furniture in the future."
2651,"just had scott out this morning to do a small drywall repair job following a roof leak.  he gave me a fair estimate just based on photos of the area sent to his email. he was on time, did quick work with minimal mess.  he retextured the area to match the existing.  we have opted to paint the wall ourselves, so he told me how to prep the area.  definitely contact him for your drywall issues."
2652,"i needed a cheap necklace fixed and there was a bit of a wait but they did the job i asked for. cost was $10 because my necklace was super tangled but hey, can't complain when someone fixes something you just can't do yourself. if i need any jewelry repair again i will return."
2653,"jason, jason, jason. i can't explain how pleasant it was to deal with jason. i called cool touch and an hour later jason was there.  my downstairs a/c had went out and i was dreading the repair. jason was amazing he found my problem right away and fixed it.  i was up and running 3 hrs after it went out. my unit has never worked better. i definitely recommend cool tough and especially jason. great dude will be using again when in need"
2654,i went with desert greenscapes to  redo my lawn for a rental property in las vegas. we went with  artificial grass and shrubs with a drip system. donald was great. everything was done to code and flawlessly exucuted. he really knows what he's doing and how to do the job right. he even recommended a plumber to repair a pipe by my water heater. the job was done beautifully and i wasn't ever needed on the property. i highly recommend this company.
2655,they returned my message in a timely message. came and checked out issue. pressure valve. also found another issue which was a previously done ...an unprofessional repair. fixed at a fair price. i will call them again.
2656,i contacted jeremy on a sunday afternoon with a yelp message and he responded in less than 15 minutes! i had jeremy come and install a bathroom fan. him and his team were very professional and went above and beyond with what i asked. i also needed a drain fixed which they adjusted very quickly. i would highly recommend using jeremy for any repairs you need around the house. jeremy is for sure my go to guy for any future handyman work. thanks again for your outstanding work jeremy!
2657,very professional. confirmed appointments. communicated clearly. worked efficiently. repaired self closing mechanisms on sliding doors without doing more than necessary. very happy with the work and the support of office staff. highly recommend.
2658,"i called upright door after calling two other repair companies since their sticker was on my garage door.  they scheduled an appointment for a free estimate.  larry is a no nonsense straight shooter.  the price he quoted to replace all 4 panels including tax was less than both of my previous quotes not including tax.  they scheduled the appointment and did the job right and left no mess.  i sell real estate and will definitely be calling them if i ever need a garage door replaced or repaired!  great job upright doors, keep up the awesome work!!!"
2659,"we were referred to griffin brothers when we moved here a year and a half ago and have gone many times, mostly for routine maintenance, and for more complicated repairs as well.  they have been terrific every time.  staff is honest, knows their stuff, and super friendly.  great days & hours, competitive pricing, and offer a shuttle ride to your home if you need it.

i wouldn't use anyone else -- that's how highly i think of them.  highly recommend."
2660,the salon's recent renovations are simply gorgeous and high end. i've been a client if tina's for awhile and she always does a great job on my mani/pedis. she knows how hard i work and she makes sure my experience is relaxing and that i leave feeling pampered. 5 stars!
2661,"this is the best company . reliable and they do great work.  recommended 100%.
i would use this company for any and all repairs."
2662,"i was worried about some of the cracks in my new house that my original inspector didn't found. i contacted kevin for sanity check. he quickly replied in yelp, and answered my call the next day. he's very knowledgable, he explained what he thought was going on, and suggested me to contact my original inspector. however i still decide to let kevin come as he seemed very trustworthy. i was able to schedule an appointment for the next day. for very little amount of charge, kevin thoroughly checked my house, found out potential issues that my previous inspector didn't find, suggested repairs and told us it's all cosmetic problem, not real structural damage. he even sent a report later in the evening. it's a huge relieve for me as a fist time house buyer. kevin is awesome."
2663,"these guys are  miracle workers.  i just had my second and third rock chip, about a quarter-size each repaired and you only see the past damage if you look very close.  the repair window was 8-12 am.  technician called 30 minutes before showing up and 8:30am, sharp.  very happy."
2664,"kevin did two home inspections for us and was very thorough. he went over all of his findings at the time of inspection, and his report followed quickly and detailed everything he discussed previously, including photos. he highlights things that should be repaired, safety concerns, normal maintenance issues, as well as things that should be monitored. he goes above and beyond and is very knowledgeable in many areas. i highly recommend kevin!"
2665,austin is a great guy. great attention to detail.  this place has consistently over delivered every time i've had repairs done.
2666,"scheduling was easy...cory is courteous,on time,efficient, knowledgeable, professional. i will definitely contact him again for any repairs."
2667,"super helpful.  they've got anything and everything you need from camera repairs to film development supplies.  however they don't develop film in this building, but their next door neighbor does!"
2668,eli is excellent. trustworthy and capable of many different types of welding repairs. i've used him to primarily fix side gates. affordable and quick. highly recommend.
2669,these guys are great. i saw there sign on the median on tatum and was happy to get my problem diagnosed for free. the repair was affordable  they gave me a quote and told me what the problem was so i priced it before comitting to the repair but it was still the best price!
2670,"andy is absolutely top notch.highly reliable and and honest pricing. he will come out and tell you what you need and how much it will cost. no up selling like some of those ""big"" companies out there. if you are in need of repairs or even a check up, make sure you call air fit."
2671,"one of the best indian restaurants in town, if not the best. the buffet is especially is worth the trip.

recent renovations have taken the restaurant from being a bit sketchy looking to downright attractive. it's not completely done just yet, but it's getting very close."
2672,"this company is fair and honest.  i knocked my hard drive tower off of the desk.  it was mangled on the outside and i thought the fan had stopped working   i was prepared to buy a new one,  luckily a friend suggested i go here and see what they said.  for only $30 they repaired the tower, tested the function and cleaned the inside.  all this in only 1 hour.  i would return if necessary."
2673,"the lockharts are awesome. i was able to get a last minute appointment to repair a permanent retainer. the staff was friendly, well educated, and fast. i was greeted with a warm welcome and smile. the facility is amazingly modern, clean, and welcoming. if i lived in nc, i'd absolutely make this orthodontist office, my primary office. support quality african american business! thanks again for the wonderful experience!"
2674,"great work by chris at our home.  we needed some baseboard work done.  chris made sure we had the right selection of baseboard and then made sure he was able to do the job efficiently 
he was prompt focused and very clean in his work 
we have had jeremey the handyman work in our home several times 
we really like the work chris does and he is a pleasure to have in your home"
2675,my company has laserjet-type printers repaired and tuan is a great printer technician. he is very experienced with these units and we are satisfied with the cost and results. thanks.
2676,"feast buffets is taking las vegas by storm! they r getting so much better each time i m here. and i heard they r also taking over the palm casino n is remodeling the palace station. can't wait to try the feast buffet at the palm when they finish the renovation. anyway, the feast at palace starion is stil one of my favorite! there is never a wait. even though it is one of the smallest feast buffet in the valley. but it is sufficient to keep u full n satisfy!"
2677,"always a pleasure to do business with this aamco.  fast and professional. 
had my truck repaired in 15 minutes."
2678,"honestly, i'm glad that i didn't read any of the former reviews of this place. i have a pair of cowboy boots that i love which i took here to replace the soles and heels on. i was given a shorter time frame than another local repair place offered which was the first positive. then, i took a chance on seeing if they would be available sooner by calling a day early. they were. that's positive #2. lastly, the work that was done was awesome. the bottoms of these boots look better than the factory work that was done fresh off the shelves. i obviously can't speak on anyone else's experience but my own, which was exceptional."
2679,we had a water leak behind our washer and dryer and needed some drywall replaced. i decided to give twd a shot at the repairs. the results turned out good and i am happy. they were quick with the work and cleaned up when they were done. only negatives - they were scheduled a few weeks out for repairs and they are a bit expensive.
2680,"these guys are legit. nice, friendly and thorough. there's no pressure to repair anything. they give you your options and let you decide what to have done. i highly recommend them!"
2681,ted has repaired several rods and a reel for me with great results !!!
2682,just want to update. i had this company out again for another windsheild repair. it was the same tech and he was again absolutely amazing. very friendly and professional. got the job done right and within a timely manner. i would recommend this company to anyone. :)
2683,"i called dror at liberty home repair to stucco a window at our home. he returned my call promptly, gave us a date to do work within 3 days and was very fair with his pricing. the work he completed for us was excellent. we will be using him again. highly recommend!"
2684,"i have a 2 story home that had a 1/2 bath on the first floor. i was hoping to add a shower to the first floor bathroom that would be affordable. we fix ugly homes have their remodelers work with you to ensure you will be happy  with the materials they use and the work they do.
they are dependable and trustworthy. they work quickly and show up when they say they will.
i couldn't be happier with the results. the shower looks like it was always there.. not like an ""add on"".  they also did a few other repair jobs i needed done in the house. 
everything looks great and i am so happy with the results. bob and daniel were the father and son crew that did the work. they were awesome!"
2685,"thank you again for handling my repair needs.
professional and courteous. 
dan s"
2686,"i had hired another company to fix my irrigation system there was water in the irrigation box. i called affordable sprinkler repair the first time - they sent to my house a man with no tools. if i tell you there is water in the box, how are you going to get it out? the guy also needed a garbage bag for the items he replaced. chaz from affordable, couldn't get the system to turn on, and that wasn't broken! chaz had to read the manual because  he didn't even understand the system. the guy who owns affordable tells me they replace not fix!
anyway...after that i call a ronnow lawn sprinkler and explain what is going on. because it was late on saturday afternoon, i needed to wait until monday, no problem. they had truck problems on monday but came first thing tuesday to my house.
sure enough...mike knew what the problem was..the wires weren't connected properly. there was noting wrong with the system now....it was the connection. took him less than 3 minutes to figure this out.
i recommed this company to everyone in the las vegas valley. i wasn't treated like a stupid woman."
2687,"thank you anytime plumbing! jonathon came out to repair our faucets. he was on time, professional and did an outstanding job.

2690,what can i say i say about this place that hasn't been said by others.  ikea is a dream come true.  it's like an adults toys-r-us.  they've got everything for your home you can imagine.  and as someone who's bought a bunch of their furniture (and shipped it home to hawai'i piece by piece) the assembly of those items can really be done by anyone...from the construction handyman type...to the couch potato!  the mock up display rooms cater to your senses and they allow you to come up with some pretty cool ideas on your own...once they've inspired you.  and before leaving don't forget to stop off in the cafe for those famous and oh so good meatballs!
2691,i went to sadie a few weeks ago for a repair she was fantastic and awesome. she definitely knows what she's doing and is very professional i would highly recommend her thanks sadie!
2692,you can't go wrong choosing comfort experts for your hvac needs. i found this company using a random google search and boy am i happy that i did. ryan has exceeded my expectations for an hvac vendor and has showed professionalism and great communication with myself and our customers on top of superb repair quality. i highly recommend comfort experts for all hvac needs.
2693,"this is our fifth year with season tickets.  we love going to all of the games.  the staff is always helpful and friendly, the seats are easy to find and the concessions are pretty good too.  

the renovations look great and we finally have seats where we can see the scoreboard.  

i-l-l......"
2694,we recently used kevin for our home inspection.  the house was a flipped foreclosure so the seller knew very little about the house.  kevin was able to give us an idea of all of the things that would need to be fixed and things we might be able to do later on (move the washer and dryer). because of his professional and thorough inspection we were able to negotiate many of the needed repairs to be done before closing.  kevin was very flexible in scheduling a reinspection to make sure the repairs were actually done. he saved us a major headache! we will definitely be using kevin again.
2695,"contacted several handyman companies concerning a drainage problem. one said it would be two weeks to schedule a visit to obtain an estimate!!!??? and then a month to schedule the work.
handyman extreme handled our estimate via text and photos within two days. brian came and constructed a customized solution for our drainage problem! work was completed to our complete satisfaction within four days of contacting them!!!! fantastic!!!! will use them again for any further work around our home"
2696,"okay, it is high time i write this review since i've been coming here once a month for the past year or so.  i fly into vegas monthly for work and this is my go-to gym when i'm in town.  i happily pay the requisite $10 for the privilege to work out  here.  why is that?  why don't i go to 1 of those behemoths like lvac?  because the staff here are chill, the gym is clean, the equipment are in good repair and the overall vibe is right for me.  people come in to workout.  i don't see anyone chit chatting and hogging up the benches or weights or acting foolish to impress the chicks."
2697,stopped in to get some repairs done. the location has plenty of friendly staff and is extremely busy at all times!
2698,a good place to be. friendly staff and helpful staff. i am going to say that they are temporarily closed until dec 5 for a renovation.
2699,i've been here a few times and it has always been so delicious and authentic!! sad news - the restaurant is closed for a year for renovations starting dec 31!
2700,"our a/c was on the blink, nothing like being in triple digits without it!  we called anthony james air and anthony came out,  we were very happy!  thought we would have to replace our 16 year old unit. he repaired the minor issue. he was very professional, honest and thorough. going forward, we will definitely call him for all of our a/c needs! we will very highly recommend him to all of our friends and family."
2701,"best plumbers in the valley! we highly recommend them and couldn't be happier. they came to fix a broken vent line in wall that roof rats were getting in through. they also fixed our slow draining kitchen sink and installed a new garbage disposal. they did this all in less then a day and came just an hour after calling them! they even rematches the wall. we found them to be extremely knowledgable and easy to work with. they even kindly worked with our home warranty company and we were able to get my company to pay for the repairs with ease. our kitchen sink and dishwasher has never drained better. they actually moved our drain connection down to be more accurate for how drains should flow now on our 1940 home. not only did they become best friends with our dog but they cleaned up after the work and did a great job. i highly recommend working with these guys. they are honest, reliable. and knowledgeable!"
2702,"been using cool concepts for 3 years for maintenance and repairs.  prompt, reliable and reasonable.   give them a call."
2703,great at returning items that were damaged or not working with no issues. just bought a house so i'm there every other day. helpful and usually have everything i need for my home repairs and remodeling.
2704,lyons roofing came out to do a roof inspection.  they told us our roof was actually in good order - what we saw was not an actual issue with the roof - and that our roof had 8-10 more years of life.  he went further and recommended some things that should be done -- and here is the best part -- they told us what and how to do it all ourselves.  the cost for this was exactly $0.  we will definitely be calling them when we do need more extensive repairs.
2705,"dexter went the extra mile and diagnosed a nasty intermittent ignition switch.   timely calls, diagnosis, and repair in a few days.  cameron called tac and isolated, repaired, and solved a mysterious malfunction that did not duplicate or present itself.  when it did, it was fixed quickly.  thanks!"
2706,"definitely would recommend this company.  victor came out, looked at the repairs we needed, got us a quote, and had the job finished within 3 weeks.
the workmen were knowledgeable and friendly. they did everything they said they would do. and, even sent pictures with the final billing. desert valley roofing is our go to company if we need any repairs in the future for our own home, or rental properties. thank you!"
2707,"jesus arrived within three hours of my call. he was professional,knowledgable and informative. initial estimates were very fair. unfortunately it was quickly determined that repairs would take more time than initially thought. however, i'm looking forward to continuing to work with bumble bee plumbing and would encourage anyone else in need of their assistance to give them a call."
2708,"thank you for friendly, knowledgeable technicians! had to deal with a horrible company previously. it's so refreshing to be treated with respect. i will definitely request you for any future repairs. happy thanksgiving!"
2709,"mark and victor delivered exactly what they quoted.  they met their timeline and the crew did an incredible cleanup.  our roof looks brand new.  i have lived in lv for 40 years and this by far is the best contractor/client encounter i have every experienced.  if you need roof repair/restoration us desert valley roofing, you won't be disappointed."
2710,"john is an absolute stand up guy, honest and reputable. if you're looking for mobile repair he should definitely be your first and last call."
2711,"javier is super professional, prompt, and an excellent communicator. i live in santa cruz ca, but have an investment property in las vegas that needed some exteriors stair repairs.

i found this gem of handyman by submitting my project on the smith app, and once he was hired, i was able to handle everything from santa cruz without having to set foot in vegas. this was due the fact that javier is trustworthy and submitted pictures as the work proceeded and was finished.  

everyone else that quoted the project wanted to completely replace the stairs. javier came in and fixed what was wrong for an excellent price and didn't try to quote unnecessary work. 

highly recommended thank you javier :)"
2712,"shower faucet decided to quit working and water was leaking by the buckets so i went to yelp to find help. i came across this company and based on reviews, decided to give them a shot since this was pressing and of course on a saturday. mike arrived on time assessed the problem and provided multiple quotes for various ways to make the repair.  it wasn't a cheap fix but mike knocked it out quickly, was very detail oriented, pleasant and trustworthy. i would call on them again and recommend them to others."
2713,"i love almost everything with the library.  my only issue is that it is far too popular/busy, but i think in part this might be due to cpl crowfoot undergoing a very long renovation creating issues.  time will tell once the cpl crowfoot renovations are complete, along with the new cpl rocky ridge location opening up in january 2018.

ps. all cpl locations have wifi; however. most have issues as their routers are only designated to accommodate 12 people at a time, or so i was told.  cpls are very popular; hence, often cpl wifi networks are either hard to get onto or drop you after a certain amount of time.  hopefully, wifi will be upgraded accordingly very soon to better accommodate the popularity of cpls.

pps. most times the bathrooms are dirty/wet for heavy use, and lack of paper towels.  the hand dryers are very hard to use for most, since you need to place your hands up into the dryer for it to work properly."
2714,"i seldom write reviews for businesses but i know how daunting it is to find a reliable handyman. i'd like to point out that brian does an exemplary job. he has a very polite and knowledgeable demeanor, and delivers excellent results. i've used this company for three jobs and i will keep using them for future needs. i especially like the fact that they base their estimates on specific details that the customer provides through pictures and measurements."
2715,"don and rob are not only dog lovers, but also excellent plumbers. they are friendly professionals. i had a broken shut off valve and had to shut off my water to my home. they came quickly to my assistance. they were incredibly prepared with all of the necessary parts. they were kind enough to repair a few more plumbing issues which i had ignored for years. they exceeded my high hopes. their prices are very fair. a good and trustworthy plumber is hard to find and if you are reading this post, believe me you have found the right plumber.  you won't be disappointed."
2716,i used scott for a small drywall repair and he did not disappoint. i sent pics via text and he immediately responded with a quote and was out the next day to do the repair. the finished texture matched the rest of the walls perfectly - you would have never known it was repaired. thanks again scott!

2731,"i have been working with melodie coy at lamps plus for a number of years.  as an interior designer, i am only as good as my resources. melodie consistently excels in understanding my design needs and helping to keep me within my budget with suggestions and selections. she is prompt, a consummate professional, friendly and has a vast and educated understanding of the often complicated aspect of lighting.  she reminds me of ceiling drops and other architectural components and asks all the proper pertinent questions rather than simply taking the order.  she has been a huge help in my renovation work and i am grateful for her eye and knowledge which she shares when asked.  melodie has also recently expedited two deliveries for me which went above and beyond.  melodie coy is an asset to both lamps plus and anyone looking for smart, tasteful, design help with lighting!"

2741,"we have used shannon and her team on our floors in 2 different homes.  we were equally as impressed with both jobs. in our main home they cleaned, repaired , polished and sealed our travertine. our floors looked like palace floors, we couldn't believe the difference. in our condo, they cleaned up the tile and did an amazing job on our patio.  quality and amazing work, delivered by professional, hard working and honest people.  every employee we met was courteous and skilled. i will be using them again and highly highly recommend them to others. you won't be disappointed!"
2742,"extremely satisfied from the beginning discussing the job through completion of the work. i had exterior painting done that was beautifully executed and when it was finished, i was really glad i had ameripro do the job. they pressure washed the stucco, made repairs to the cracks in the stucco and applied the paint to the stucco, metal surfaces and pop-outs. the repair to the cracks in the stucco was done so you wouldn't even know it was done and all the painted surfaces look perfect. the forman/quality control person (clem) made sure everything from start to finish was done to my complete satisfaction. based on my experience, i will use them again and highly recommend them. ...and oh by the way, their pricing was very reasonable as well as worth every penny."
2743,"eric did a fantastic job on our block wall repair! it was hard to get anyone to do a small block wall repair but eric came out, did an amazing job! very professional and reasonably priced. we will be using his again in the future and will recommend him to friends and family. thank you"

he was ontime, professional, and taped off work areas to minimize dust spread.  his work was wonderful. it was impossible to see where any of the old fixtures had been.

i would highly recommend him for any job"

2750,"wow! we called the same day and javier not only responded quickly but was able to assist us within only a couple hours.  he was very friendly and very knowledgeable in various handyman problems.

2753,"i recently had a 2 chips in my window and by chance met anthony the owner of greenshield at my kids school, i asked if the chips could be repaired and what do i need to do if so.   he was very polite and professional and explained the importance of having the chips repaired before they caused more damage to the window and that he would be able to fix it right then and there if i would like. he did such an amazing job, i can't even see the chips anymore. it also didn't take much time at all, it was quick and a beautiful job. i will use greenshield again and recommend to anyone needing a window repair."

2757,great job!! we had a leak in our master closet as well as some displaced tiles. they came out for the estimate used an ipad to show us the roof and where it needed to be repaired.  they came out on time it cleaned up everything after and we no longer have a leak. i've check every time it has rained. dry as a bone. but we have a year. very happy and i would recommend them to anyone who needs some roof work done.

2761,steve and his wife came out to repair my wooden entrance steps. they did a great job. the best part was that he didn't bother me until the job was done and i was able to sleep. looking forward to giving him more projects to do around my home in the future. he really wanted to get the job done and i like that type of business.

2765,they quickly scheduled the repair for the garage door and did a nice job.  nice warranty as well.
2766,"i got home tonight and my water heater was leaking. it flooded the garage. i looked outside and saw a sunny plumber truck outside of my neighbor's house. i ran over and caught the handsome sunny plumber man and asked him to come over and take a look at the flood (gosh he was cute). came over, stopped the flood, told me it was some valve that was leaking, fixed it, and didn't try to sell me a bunch of other crap like the rest of them do. i guess they really are the bright and shiny repairmen! i'd recommend them to anyone."
2767,"quick response time on emergency repairs, great communication, friendly and professional staff. shout out to cherish in particular, she's very helpful and always friendly, even when i sometimes bombard the office with calls and emails."
2768,"my ill 75 year old mother had just discovered there was no hot water and wanted it fixed! being new to the area, i received matt's name from a friend who just built a house and i hoped he handled smaller projects also. 

after calling matt, he was able to come out the same day and totally rebuild our 40 plus year old hot water heater that day!! 

before matt started he covered options and explained the pros and cons of each so i felt i could make an informed decision. matt then picked up all materials, repaired the water heater, and removed all debris from the job site. 

i have used matt several times for projects around the home and each has been handled in the same professional matter. if you are looking for a knowledgeable, dependable and affordable plumber for large and small projects, look no further than plumb masters!!"
2769,"i've been to this location a few times and the staff are always friendly and quick, but thorough. i've never experienced the aggressive up-sell described by another reviewer. they even went the extra mile and recommend a local garage for an unrelated repair that i needed!"

2773,"woodlands is the best pizza place in the area. when i moved to ontario, i would make a special trip to verdun when i was in town visiting. now that they're closed for renovations, i go to their location in chateauguay. i crave the pepperoni they use on their pizzas. absolutely the best pizza and poutines around."

2780,"this is a wonderful company! plumbing issues are never fun or inexpensive. we have used miller plumbing and heating more than several times in the past 8 years. we keep returning to them. they have proven themselves to be experts in their field, empathetic to our troubles, expedient, earnest to do quality work,  more than fair in their pricing, and honest. recently, for example, they could have charged $500 for a fix they discovered we actually did not need.  rather than do the job and charge us the money (we would have never known the difference) they were more than happy to let us know that we did not need the repair after all and were happy to save us the $500.. pretty cool. plumbing issues happen! you can't go wrong with this company!"
2781,this guy is awesome!! he came out and fixed our door the same day. he explained why he needed to do multiple repairs and was reasonable on price. definitely will call him next time.
2782,"outstanding family-owned company!  fast and knowledgeable with fair, reasonable rates.  ryan knew exactly what needed to be done to repair our garage door and opener.  a previous 5-star company could not repair our opener but charged us anyway saying ""it must be something wrong with the inside of the opener, so we can't fix it.""  they were right that something inside the opener needed to be fixed and ryan knew exactly what the problem was and fixed it.  we are recommending this family-owned company to everbody in our complex!!!!!"
2783,"viorel was very helpful with communications via yelp to help diagnose a problem with my microwave. he gave me potential issues and costs associated with the repair needed.
he arrived early and within 20 minutes the problem was determined and repaired. 

he was very nice, very knowledgeable and professional.

highly recommend having viorel on speed dial!"
2784,"i have been here several times for jewelry repairs and keith never disappoints.  he has fixed many pieces of mine quickly and economically. i have never bought a piece of jewelry here, but it would for sure be my first stop when the need arrives.  thank you, keith!"
2785,"clean, some renovations under way."
2786,"chance went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations on this job. i had a leak in between the house and the main and i got 8 bids. his bid was one of the best. he even went out and bought some sod to make sure and repair the grass after he finished the job. excellent work, great communication, and a great price. i will not hesitate to call him again if i need plumbing work done!"
2787,"one of the best experiences i've ever had with any company. manny was outstanding. not only did he give the garage door the tlc it needed, he explained to me everything he was doing along the way and gave me a bunch of helpful tips for maintaining the door myself regularly. he was extremely friendly and professional. i can't say enough good things. these are my new go-to guys for garage doors repairs and maintenance!"
2788,"i can't say enough about how outstanding jeremy the handyman company was.   i sent a request for a quote and was answered promptly.   pricing was very reasonable, and time frame was set up.  when his team arrived, they were prompt, professional and quick but did an amazing job.  i will be recommending and using jeremy again."
2789,i called seven different plumbing companies and atlas was the right one for me. pete came out and repaired our issue quickly and he cleaned up before he left
2790,"job done. no complaints. it was a warranty repair for my fridge. scott came out, looked it over. ordered some parts and in a week and a half it was fixed in an hour. it only took that long because it was over that long holiday stretch from christmas to new year's. thank you."
2791,best indian restaurant ever! i have tried indian restaurants all over the world and none comes close to coriander. the restaurant is currently undergoing renovation. once it is complete the line to get in is going to be out the door.
2792,"great people, great work. these guys were on time, kept their word and straight up honest people. being from the east coast,  and accustomed to things getting done asap, these guys did not disappoint. if ever in an emergency or need anything done related to garage repair, home repairs, do not hesitate to hit these guys up. my garage is working better than when the house was new!

thank you again!!!!"
2793,"philip was our technician and he did and incredible job. he arrived in a timely manner, informed me throughout the repair and cleaned up afterwords. he even gave me options to choose from which was really helpful!"
2794,master movers moved us into our new house a couple weeks ago and it went flawlessly. everyone was professional and courteous. i highly recommend them and would use them again if i need something moved. jason is also a handyman and has helped us in that arena too. i don't think i'll ever use anyone again. thank you!!!!
2795,"we needed a couple of quick fixes around the house. i contacted dror last night and he was here by mid-day today to fix the items on my list at a very reasonable price. needless to say, we will be giving dror a call next time we are in need of a handyman."
2796,"the granite guys are such an amazing company to deal with. from the initial process of picking out my granite, the ladies at the front were so helpful and their suppliers were so easy to deal with when i went to the warehouse. the guy who came to do the templating was great and had a lot of patience to answer all my questions and make me feel so comfortable with the process. he explained everything and left me detailed notes on what i needed to do before the install.  on the day of the install, three guys came as i have a smaller entrance and there were punctual, nice and very friendly. i was unable to do one of the tasks they required and they were more than helpful in getting it done for me to make my countertop look great. they worked hard and kept me informed throughout the whole process. my countertop looks fantastic and you can't even tell where the seams are unless you knew.  for my next renovation, i will not hesitate to call them again."
2797,"had an emergency situation with a water heater and a timeline for leaving the area. ""water heaters only"" had a repairperson to my house in less than two hours, as promised. the repairperson, don, diagnosed the problem, gave me options, and repaired the water heater in 30 minutes. he was knowledgeable, efficient and friendly! excellent wok!"
2798,"took a bangle to repair and david made a beautiful work with it. fast, efficient and professional. he was also very friendly and pleasant to deal with."
2799,"i used them again and juan figueroa came out to assist, he was punctual, professional, and knowledgeable. he reviewed the various options and gave recommendations for the issue i was having with my shower.  i would recommend him and would request him for any of my future repairs."
2800,"excellent job! the technician brian was prompt, respectful, and cleaned up after the work. i would highly recommend handyman xtreme."
2801,"we've had schoonover out a couple times over the years and they always do an awesome job.  very friendly and professional. very reasonable rates and will never up-sell anything.  they don't benefit financially if they find some other plumbing issue as they only clear/clean drains, no repair.  this is a company you can trust"
2802,"we were out of town when the dog sitter called to say our hot water heater was spewing water all over our garage. she was able to get the water turned off, tank drained and electricity turned off to the unit.  through our home warranty company we were put in contact with water heaters only. they had don come out at 8 am the morning after we arrived home.  we clearly needed a new water heater, but previous owners had built cabinets in such a way the tank could not be removed. don gave us explicit instructions on how the cabinets should be moved. we contacted our handyman and he came out and moved the shelves.  don came within an hour after he left and removed the old tank and hooked up the new one.  he insured there was no damage to the drywall - treated the area to prevent any mold growing - installed a drip pan under the new water heater and attached a drain so that any overflow would go away from the cabinets to the garage floor.  in addition to being an expert in this field, don was an absolute professional.  in addition, the gentleman at the main office was courteous, helpful and insured everything was in place to get our water heater replaced. thank you don.  we will always refer our friends and associates to this company."
2803,"kids had fun, a few repairs needed, but in pretty good shape as far as mini golf goes"
2804,we will definitely use again if needed. our technician was jason. he was knowledgeable and very polite. fixed what needed to be done then inspected the whole system with us and made some preventative repairs. we are very happy with the work and felt it was a good value.
2805,very good quality one of the best new renovations payed off
2806,"arturo is the best! he is great at diagnosing problems, discussing how the repair will take place and showing the new replacement parts. he is very knowledgable and kind."
2807,"second time having this company out to make plumbing repairs and another great experience! 
this time ken replaced the garbage disposal. 
he was clean and neat and the job was complete in just a few minutes! 
this company gets all our business for anything plumbing!"
2808,took my 1971 reinell down for stern drive repairs. jimmy and scott were great to deal with. straight forward and did it for the price they quoted.
2809,had a minor plumbing repair and kyle handled the job professionally.  i will definitely call this company again to have my water heater replaced and possible even the water treatment system kyle was kind enough to recommend.
2810,"great experience.  our double door garage broke! we thought we were going to have to replace the door. aaron's associate was able to repair the door, and found a bigger and potentially injurious problem in our single door.  both doors have been repaired, and are working better than ever!  the job was done timely, the associate was super courteous, and i am very happy!"
2811,"very prompt and extremely knowledgeable. absolutely no pressure  no sales gimmicks. technicians/repairmen are salaried. fair, competitive pricing."
2812,"this place just opened on parc, and it already feels like home. it smells like fresh donuts and coffee, which is how i want every place to smell. the donuts are traditional russian style, which makes them smaller and lighter than what you might be used to.  they are light and sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. they are made to order and fried in front of your eyes, which makes them super fresh. the coffee is fresh and supplied by 49th parallel (a vancouver-based roaster). i had a double-shot espresso with a thick crema and a sweet aftertaste, and i loved it. 

the atmosphere in here is also really welcoming. floor to ceiling windows, the shiny blue floors, and fresh white walls give this place tons of natural light. it's the perfect place to meet friends or read a book, and there is even a huge bookcase of take-one-leave-one books and board games for patrons to enjoy. almost all of the tables were up-cycled and renovations done by boris and grant themselves, two of the smilest guys on the planet.

come in for a quick coffee and donut, or stay and make friends. either way, you'll love chez boris and all of its delights."
2813,"we have been using dean and olympic air for several years now and couldn't be happier. dean has helped us limp our very old air conditioner along for at least 5 years, always with us thinking, ""this is the year we need to replace it."" not so until this year when our 21 year old air conditioner finally bit the dust. when other companies would likely have tried to upsell us a new unit, dean just kept pushing to the very end and got maximum life out of the unit.
it all began on monday, 06/23 when the ac unit wouldn't turn on. dean came out that very day and determined it was finally beyond repair. he quickly pulled together a quote with 3 options, all of which we were comfortable with. by tuesday, we had a new unit installed and all is well (and cool!) again in our house.
dean is a super friendly, professional, and helpful partner to have on your side. he has our biggest endorsement!"
2814,"i have had them do repair work in the past and always prompt, professional and do great work. today they installed a new pump and filter. the installers were john r and james j. you could not ask for nicer or more competent technicians. they really took their time to explain everything to me, which i really appreciated. also, it literally took them less than an hour and a half to remove the old equipment, install the new equipment and haul away the old stuff. i give them and this company my highest recommendation. really nice job."
2815,"tiffany's is the best. 
handle my st john couture with tlc. all the clothing cleaned and repaired and packaged are always perfect. 
staff is terrific. friendly, professional and genuine. 
thank you !!!"
2816,stopped here to get a small repair done on our travel trailer axel. everyone we came in contact with was super nice and very helpful. it was easy to make an appointment and we didn't have to wait long for the repair to be completed. would highly recommend this business if you have any trailer needs!
2817,jeremy (owner of academy plumbing & repair) did some plumbing work for me the other day. great guy. presents himself well. works fast. on time. and his prices were significantly better than my original quote. highly recommended.
2818,"contacted chas roberts this morning to do some warranty work on a broken ventilation fan in my attic.  i had read a lot of bad reviews on chas roberts in the past, so my expectations were not sky high from the beginning, but the warranty/original install was done by them on my new build, so i didn't have much of a choice on who to call unless i wanted to pay for the repair myself.

called them at 8am and was told that they'd have a repairman out to me between 12-4pm, which was fine.  i received a call appx 30 minutes later from the repairman, ralph, who told me he was in the area and asked it would be ok to stop by earlier. of course, this sounded great to me.

ralph showed up a few minutes after 9am and was very friendly and professional.  he had the work completed in about an hour.  i couldn't have been happier.

i won't hesitate to use them again, whether it was their original work or not."
2819,"i've had two pairs of boots repaired and rebuilt here, and the owner, sam, is great to deal with.  he has always been honest and straightforward, and i've gotten great quality work done.  i have no hesitation recommending him and his business."
2820,"galloway painting owned by mark galloway did a fantastic job painting our 5 bedroom house. he was competitively priced repaired all ceiling cracks repaired doors painted trim painted rooms blended paint power washed the outside and cleaned up the foundation. i got a lot of bang for my buck. they were extremely neat, cleaned up , and did a great job for a very reasonable price . i highly recommend galloway painting . call mark and you won't be disappointed !"
2821,they were so kind and extended a great rate to our family when we needed a place quickly. out water well konked out on us and needed a place to stay while repairs were made. very friendly to us as locals. clean rooms. quiet locations lovely staff.
2822,"nicklin manages my property in las vegas, though i live in california.  i've had a few maintenance issues recently, and i've found their maintenance department to be very helpful and quick to respond.  i was especially appreciative of shari, who went above and beyond my expectations in coordinating with contractors and with my hoa to make sure that all of the repairs met the hoa's requirements.  kudos to shari and thank you for all of your help."
2823,caleb came at the time he said and repaired my sink perfectly and in and timely manner. definitely will use them again!!!
2824,what an enchanting oasis in old town.  i love this place for quick repairs on necklaces/bracelets (beats 'fix it fast' bar none any day all day). just the place to place to visit for when you want to get creative as well. if you have a ladies occation coming up this would be a cute place to make some bracelets for the bunch. i also like how everything is clean and organized not to mention how polite the staff is there.
2825,thank you tiffany and maria for all of the great recommendations for our kitchen remodel. i love the outcome and definitely recommend for renovations!
2826,"doug and ryan arrived on time.  they tested the gcfi receptical and other recepticals on the same circuit, determined the problem and made the repair.  best of all, they ended up charging less than their estimate.  very professional in both their manner and conduct."
2827,my niece bought her sister an old polaroid camera for her birthday from ebay.  the flash didn't work and my niece was devastated.  we took it to sun camera hoping they could repair it. he figured it out in a few minutes and fixed it on the spot for my niece at no charge.  this place is the best.  you don't get help like that anywhere anymore.  i will come to sun camera for all our family camera needs.
2828,"may 2016 update: we're selling our las vegas house and the buyer's inspector noticed rust stains beneath the a/c condensate drain pipes. bond hvac tested the pressure on both a/c units and confirmed that the pipes were not clogged (""you would have had a rusty ceiling leak"") and both were functioning normally. we had low refrigerant last summer (had some added) that's what likely caused rusty water to drip from the pipes. so no big repair bill, just a house call to confirm that the a/c units are fine! i highly recommend bond hvac."
2829,closed for renovation. not sure how long.  4 rating since didn't eat there and that was the average.
2830,liberty home repair did an awesome job of installing a stove range hood for my duplex very good quality and very good value
2831,"so grateful to bumblebee for getting me on the schedule to fix a slow leak under my bathroom sink. jesus arrived right on time, was professional, courteous and took steps to explain the pricing and the repair process. this is my first time ever having to call a plumber out and i will not hesitate to use bumblebee in the future. highly recommend."
2832,"we've lived in fountain hills since 1993 and have experienced four different ac companies over that time. i know a fair amount about ac/heating so we tossed the rest and only use mike jones at discount air. 

fast response, honest, reasonable pricing. not a rip and replace company, discount will repair even 20 yr old systems if it makes sense."
2833,i would recommend this company to my friends and family. johnathon was friendly and kept me informed of the progress. the repair was done quickly and fixed to my satisfaction. i did have to pay additional money from non covered rock chips on the hood.
2834,i am just so impressed by this place. pricing was completely reasonable and they gave me different options of fabric to make a decision that worked best for me and my budget. i needed a pretty big repair to my drivers seat and i live 45 minutes away so they were able to get the whole job done within the day since you can't really drive without a drivers seat! i am so appreciative and the seat looks great!
2835,"before the renovation, pure was one of my favorite clubs in vegas and now after it still love this place. 
the promoters working for omnia are always great. fast ""staff guest list"" line. 
great outdoor patio and crazy interior."
2836,very fast response and all issues solved within 24 hours of my inquiry. great handyman for small repairs and general maintenance.
2837,"air supply sent 3 hvac professionals within less than 24 hours to replace a ""vintage"" unit (tricky just for that), it was allegedly blowing hot and cold air according to a buyer's inspection. if vintage parts could be available, it would take weeks to arrive. the hv unit had to be repaired or replaced within less than 24 hours to close.  air supply replaced the unit with a new one and repaired/replaced the tubes and hoses as required on the a/c unit so that we were to meet repair requirements in such a short amount of time in order to close on a home sale on time.  costs were reasonable (quotes previously obtained).  technicians were courteous and skilled."
2838,"matt is truly an asset to your company.  he is honest, fast, and very knowledgeable.  i appreciate the fast response and the quick repair.  thanks again!"
2839,we did four home inspections with kevin and we found him very reliable. kevin emails and work with buyers agent and the seller to schedule a time. after inspection he did show us everything that he found. his reports are very through and were helpful to negotiate repairs with the owners. he takes photos of everything and prepares detailed report which also helps to keep track of any future repair needs. we highly recommend him for any of your inspection needs!!
2840,"very happy we used dror for our tenant's drywall repair!
he did an amazing job. you can't even tell there was ever a giant hole in the ceiling, he patched it up perfect! and the ceiling paint in our tenant's utility closet wasn't an exact match, so he was kind enough to go the extra mile and just paint the whole ceiling so that everything matched.
he was prompt and punctual! would 100% use again!"
2841,"fast, friendly, professional. explained the problem in plain english and fixed it right away.  for handyman work, or for a problem with your house where you're not sure who to call, call these guys.  i couldn't be happier with the work and could not give them a stronger recommendation."
2842,"this company is awesome!! today was the second time they've done work for us. shaun replaced our water heater earlier this year and pete completed three smaller items today. pro handyman/las vegas handyman employees are professional, reliable, and efficient. they recommend the most cost effective solution and don't try to up-sell or suggest more expensive repairs just to generate more $$$. their prices are extremely reasonable.  i'll call them every time i need any repair, big or small!!"
2843,great company. called and came out and promptly and professionally fixed a broken cable.  no push for something i didn't need or an additional unnecessary repair.  their communication is top notch and also have all of the tools to do the job right that i had never seen before.  they have a perfect rating for a reason - customer for life.
2844,what a great group of guys. i brought my dodge charger here to be repaired after it started to overheat. they fixed the issues in good time and didn't over charge me. thanks guys!
2845,"the new scoop on fork!  i recently wrote that it was closed for renovations, but it's already open again.  this is awesome news for fork fans like me.  can't wait to check it out!"
2846,"what a great experience!  i scheduled an appointment for repair of our vertical blinds. heath called to say he was on the way, and arrived right at scheduled time. the work was extensive and he spent over an hour at the house. he was professional, obviously knows what he's doing and a really nice guy. price was very fair. i would high recommend!"
2847,"ron has done many projects on my home and i will use him again. he's professional and trustworthy not to mention does a great job. i've used him to paint, renovate my kitchen, reframe doors, install countertops repair ceilings due to leaks and more. he does it all. i would give him six stars!!"
2848,"called gmr plumbing to install a pressure regulator and repair a tp valve on the water heater. had the pleasure of dealing with jerry. he was very responsive, answered all of my questions, and was very polite in doing so. i called him a few hours after he completed the repairs to ask a question and he was very helpful. 

these guys are straightforward, no bs, skillful plumbers. i'll be sure to recommend!"

2850,mike quickly diagnosed the problem with retracting our large wall slide. he was patient in explaining how to remove the slide motor and reinstall a new one so we could complete the repair. he also shared tips on re-syncing the slide and keeping it in good working order. mike is very affordable and saved us money by taking the time to share his expertise. mike and his team have earned our business.

2855,"it's surprisingly difficult to find a company in las vegas that isn't trying to scam you, but i genuinely trust las vegas handyman. they're not out to rip you off, for one. they do good work and they stand behind it. my experiences have been with adam, whom i refer to as the ""handiest man"" because he can fix anything."
2856,"i can't tell you how refreshing it is when you meet hard working and honest people. i had penguin air tell me i needed a new 3200 condenser on a unit that is only 6 years old, i had another company give me a quote for double the price of his repair. finally i asked around and being new to az i decided to trust the reviews on next door, and found lj. he came and had the ac up and running in 20 min. i couldn't believe it. honestly, i'm almost in tears just thinking about how much i appreciate this company and the money they saved me. so many ac companies take advantage of women and i'm so glad i found this company. thank you!!!!"
2857,"first time i have used ac by j. my only regret is that i didn't know about them sooner. i called in the morning and by mid-day the tech was onsite. one hour later my ac was up and running again which in 110 degree heat that meant a lot! the tech was knowledgeable, friendly, clean and professional. thank you ac by j for doing what you said, when you said without all the up-charging that so many companies do. i don't wish for more repairs but should i need something, ac by j will get the call. thanks"
2858,came here after doing a google search to find the closest vacuum repair and i was fortunate to find this place.  i have a dyson which i thought was an awesome vacuum (not that i ever use this stupid thing).  turns out they make some badass vacuums and this place sells them.  i wont go into it but my next vacuum will be bought from this place.  in the mean time they completely went over my dyson and made some repairs since it was super loud and not working efficiently.  my wife says it works like new again and that's all that matter to me.
2859,thank you marc cakebread for doing an excellent pre inspection on my home. we are now educated on everything we should repair prior to putting our home on the market. you are a true professional and i will recommend you to everyone i know.
2860,my truck was leaking fuel from underneath. i checked my area on yelp and decided to give parrott a try due to the reviews. i've decided i'm the smartest guy i know. he was great fixed my truck same day called me to pick it up and saved me about $70 on the repair. would have been 5 star but the waiting room didn't have coffee. i needed some.
2861,"finally a reasonable sprinkler repair company!  great, professional experience and we appreciated the honesty and integrity they showed in doing the repairs with our bottom line in mind.  we would call them again if the need arises."
2862,my garbage disposal stopped working . another company told me to purchase a new one costing over $100 and he would replace it  in 2 days and pay $85 for labor. getz handyman responded and fixed the issue on the same day saving me time and $$$. i didn't even need a new disposal.  i will be calling them for all my handyman needs !!!!
2863,"bill has exceeded our expectations as a handyman. he is reliable, dependable and trustworthy. he is very skilled and professional. he has helped with our electrical, plumbing and hvac needs. he is both responsive and receptive. you will not be disappointed."
2864,"ask for andy! 

i had damaged the front end of my 2016 durango...within a few minutes i was helped, given an estimate of work, not only that...they gave me a general idea of what could be the highest estimate for this damage. honest.

they had the repair done in two days. andy took the time to explain everything and did a walk around of the finished work to ensure my satisfaction. 

and...the best part...the cost was the lowest estimate!!! 

i recommend this place if you are needing quality work, in a timely manner. andy brandler is the best!"
2865,jacob did some cabinet work for us. he responded quick and gave us a quote immediately. he got the work done and came out so much better than i expected . i will highly recommend getz handyman for your needs.
2866,"mark, the handyman assigned to my project, was extremely polite and helpful. he installed wood blinds in 8 windows and cleaned up so well you wouldn't know he had been there."
2867,stacy and cameron always help me out when i need something. the work they do is quality stuff. they'll give you a breakdown of repairs and will let you know if something is high priority or if it's just recommended. i wouldn't say they are the cheapest but good work is usually not cheap.
2868,"i had a very nasty review last year that i like to think helped turnover the staff. so here's my update since then:

darla & jerzy are amazing and seem more experienced in prioritizing tenant's concerns professionally. simply being greeted by my name went a long way. maintenance is fast as well and the renovations are something to be excited about.

4 stars is only because my rent is in the thousands now for my 1 bedroom compared to 2015 and some neighbors can be very obnoxious and loud (my neighbor always slams her damn door!) however, this has nothing to do about the new and improved staff"
2869,this place is the best in the valley. had my race suit fixed and modified. i had an idea on how to do it would have been very expensive. they showed me a better way and way cheaper! go here for any leather repair! can't say thank you enough great job !!
2870,"lamont was a great technician. i was skeptical to just hand off my ipad but he did a great job. he was easy to communicate with, flexible in scheduling, and was on time to meet me and when he said the repair would be done. his price was cheaper than any other place i called and i didn't have to go anywhere to drop off or pick up my ipad."
2871,"i had a break in my underground pvc pipes and left a message on sunday.   luke from down under called me monday,  and was at my house early tuesday morning.  my pipes were repaired that day! !  we had even agreed on a fair price,  but luke found an additional broken pipe,  and repaired that as well with no additional charge.   i also have an issue with my salt chlorinator that requires some welding of a limiter,  and although luke stated that was not something he repairs,  he took pictures of the issue and sent to an associate to see if he could help.   i'm just waiting on a response.   i definitely recommend down under and have already referred them to co - workers."
2872,i was in the need of 2 dog doors and my husband is a good handyman but i wanted it to look like it built with the house and not an add on. jgm pet doors installed one at my house and one at my daughters. my house was typical az stucco and my daughters was block concrete. they did an amazing job. very professional and honest. worth every penny.
2873,this company was great! they seem to be able to do many different kinds of repairs and installations. i had laminate floor replacement done & i had ceiling work done and both jobs were excellent.
2874,"george is honest, hard working and get's any job done.  i just had my transmition repaired and i would use him again in a heart beat."
2875,had to repair my drivers window. it only took the technician lonnie maybe 45 mins. he was very professional and kind. i would definitely recommend them for your window repairs.
2876,"big g plumbing was sent out because i was unable to turn the water off at my clothes washer.  they were great, they called me and scheduled right away. they were on time which is a plus!  

he had to cut into my drywall to fix the problem but it was a small repair and he cleaned it up when he was done.  

this place was amazing, i've worked with plumbing companies in the past and i've had some good experiences, no complaints but i never had my expectations blown away and that is exactly what they provided!"

2892,"having a solar hot water heater i wanted to contact a company who knew how to repair the water heater properly. i contacted aqua science who sent a tech to my home. 
the tech was great, he told me of two ways to fix the problem. he also recommended one way which would cost a bit more, however, stop more costly repairs later.
although we were ready to make the decision to move forward, the july 4th weekend started the following day. 
we had to have the repairs done by another company, only because we were unable to get a tech from aqua science to make the repairs within a few days."

2897,great experience with pipe dreams. cj & zach repaired a hot water slab leak that they painstakingly traced. they were respectful and apologetic as they had to cut and eliminate the leak. i appreciate their concern and cj explaining every step of the process. i highly recommend pipe dreams and is the only plumbers i will use in the future.

the master bathtub faucet was leaking. arturo came in the evening and spent hours fixing it. not only was his fee very reasonable, but he also guaranteed his work with a 3-month warranty. he even taught my dad how to use the jacuzzi feature in the tub.

now, here's the really good thing about arturo. when the master bathtub faucet starting leaking again less than a month later, we called arturo, who honored his word and warranty. he came by the next day, and fixed it again, this time with the part that he recommended. he didn't charge us a thing for this visit.

2979,"referrals are the best, and i'm glad i was referred to upright. larry (the owner himself) came out and installed my new garage door opener. he was quite a character.  reminded me of a feisty henry fonda from the movie on golden pond (but minus the old age) larry is a real fire cracker! no bullshitting with this guy. he gives it to you straight. i liked him very much. he also recommended if i ever need electrical repairs to use eco electric, which i did yesterday and i liked them too! larry showed me that my new garage door did not have ""insulation panels"" which i never even heard of? here is my edit: do not buy those pink fiberglass insulation panels they sell at home depot!  use the styrofoam lightweight ones that are made for garage doors.  i've used upright twice now. i think they are very good."
2980,"our furnace broke down the evening of the coldest day of the year.  we called gorjanc the following morning, and they responded within an hour.  the gentleman who came out found that we needed a new furnace:  the heat exchanger on the old one could not be repaired.  after he left mr. gorjanc arrived and helped us select a very efficient gas furnace.  the following day it was installed by two knowledgeable, polite, and hard-working men, frank and zack.  they not only installed the furnace,  but they also found a water tank pipe that was too narrow, and they fixed that too. also, the cleanup was perfect. we could not be happier with the job."
2981,"i already liked the old decor but the new renovation is beautiful. glad they are opened, my sis in law was sad when i told her they shut down because according to her they made the best strawberry milk tea. i didn't realize they were only closed for renovation. yay! for the hubz and i we love the mocha with the sea salt & red bean. 4 star only for the hours of operation."
2982,"very professional and reasonable handyman, thank goodness we found him. had a terrible leaky shower faucet with the hot water running continuously of all things. started as a drip & ended  up sounding like the shower was on all day. as soon as he arrived and got halfway up the stairs he already knew the issue & resolved the matter properly! i will definitely call on him again.

2990,"we are a small hoa that required a major renovation of our deteriorated and unused tennis court into a park-like setting for a new use for our homeowners.  we selected andrew to do the design work for us.  andrew not only provided us a beautiful design but met with our board repeatedly to answer questions, educate us, and even provided updated designs as the membership and board made changes to the original design. he was always reliable, meeting any deadlines we requested.   he was never resistant to changes we requested and  worked within our budget -- was very gracious about our limited funds -- and provided time over and above what one would expect.  andrew is extremely knowledgeable about landscape, has great design sense and skills, and really worked closely with us.  we didn't have a chance to meet his brothers, but we were satisfied in every way with andrew's talents, skills, demeanor and responsiveness."
2991,good repair visit.  timely and cost effective!

2993,"we drove 5 hours to phoenix to help our daughter with some repairs on her cruze, jesse was our guy. of course he fixed everything perfectly but the reason i decided to write this review is because even though he knew we were paying, he attempted to deal with, or include our daughter in every conversation. as a parent i appreciate this because it gives her the confidence to do it on her own the next time...i'm guessing he's a wonderful dad too."
2994,"quick , excellent , quality repair , samir who assisted me is very cordial and attentive to your particular needs . 
i highly recommend !

meiko powers. cfii"
2995,i do quite a bit of construction work and for the most part this home depot usually has exactly what i require as far as tools and materials go. some of items that are stocked there aren't as high quality as i'd like but overall it's perfect for the everyday homeowner looking to repair something or start up a home project. the staff greeter was very knowledgeable and pointed me to the exact aisle of my desired product just by memory.
2996,"jamison has been my go-to handyman for quite some time now.  i ask for his help about every two to three months after i have compiled a ""honey do"" list.  he completes each task quickly and i couldn't be happier. he is very thorough with his work, very friendly, trustworthy and cleans up after himself.  these four qualities are essential for me when asking someone to work.  he is so trustworthy; he has a key to my house.  i can't say enough good things about him.  i have referred him to many of my friends and they always thank me for the referral.  i highly recommend him to anyone seeking a hard working, professional person."

2998,honest. dependable. detailed. quick! such a great experience with mike! he seriously does it all. shelves mounted perfectly centered and leveled. made sure i was happy with where they were and asked later if they were holding up okay. he's on the list. calling him first if we ever need a handyman again.
2999,"read the other reviews; really this is how all businesses should operate. they know what they are doing. i think they do authorized repair for most luggage brands.
they are very honest and reasonable prices.
we have brought samsonite luggage for repairs. usually within two weeks we receive a brand new piece of luggage from samsonite, replacing the one that needed a repair. 
highly recommend them even if they are far away from most of us!"
3000,"i'be been using them several month's now for both cutting grass &. trimming bushes, sprinkler repair, etc, & am very happy with them. dave & his crews treat your yard as their own. on a 1 to 5 scale, i rate them a 10!"
3001,"they are the best i've found. they are dependable, polite and excellent at making all kinds of repairs. i have nothing but good things to say about this company!"
3002,"my wife's suv was rear ended recently and the bumper sustained several scrapes, and had two areas that were pushed in.  the bumper is a rubber/plastic type material.

since we elected to have the bumper repaired and not replaced, my expectations were fairly low. i had a hard time envisioning how they were going to reshape the plastic to correct the two areas that were pushed in.

however, the results were perfect. the bumper looks as good as new.  i give this"
3003,"we called this company in july in arizona and they came out right away and diagnosed the problem. they were knowledgeable, friendly, and honest. they gave us our options for repair and explained the pros and cons of each option. they fixed our ac unit very quickly and let us know everything they were doing. what a great company with integrity!! i have no doubt they take pride in their business. i would definitely recommend this company for heating and cooling needs."
3004,"i was in dire need of a professional home inspector and found one!  ryan of greenlight rei was very professional and very detailed on his inspection.  my 1 year warranty was almost up on my newly built home. he assured me that he will look into everything that needs to be fixed or needing future repairs.  ryan inspected everything, the roof, the attic, the rooms, electricity, the plumbing, base of the house and even a 360 degree areal view of the house.  his final report with photos that shows to the builder what needs attention was the one the impressed me the most!   it is so much easier now to submit this to the builder for warranty repairs.   thank you ryan!!!   go with greenlight rei!"
3005,"we have purchased over 25 homes in different parts of the us and engaged home inspections for most of those properties.  we do our research and generally end up with a solid understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the houses before buying as a result of those inspections.  i'm taking the time to write this recommendation because paul is by far our favorite home inspector we've experienced.  he is extremely detail oriented, but has a process where he moves through the property in an appropriate amount of time.  he is personable and takes the time to educate you on how the home works, the range of issues from safety to major repair concerns and does it in a way where you can't help but be in awe of how much information he can process in the time at the property (and then translate that into a 50+ page report the same day).  paul is very experienced, unbiased, honest and working for you as the homebuyer."
3006,they were quick to respond and had a reasonable price for the work.  would definately recommend to anyone in need of roof repair.
3007,"tj was at my home earlier this week. he fixed the dead bolt on a door, cleaned my decorative drop kitchen ceiling, replacing defective fluorescent lighting and repaired the ac drain to ""fit"" into the rain gutter...was dripping on the ground. he will be returning for other projects as he was timely and very communicative, explaining all aspects of what he was doing. i cannot give him enough words of praise and am so happy that i found him!"
3008,"so glad to have found such a capable, honest, and reliable handyman.  he responds promptly to my inquiries and is professional and courteous.  i called him about a small project and he happened to be in the area and was at my house that afternoon.  he patiently explained and showed me the different types of caulking and why he chooses to use that one for my project, and explained to me how the windows were set in my house and why i didn't need to worry about moisture getting in.  he pointed out some areas i didn't notice and sealed those too.  very impressed with him."
3009,"we had an old stained glass lamp that was damaged in our move to las vegas.  glass art studio made it perfect! although the glass panels in the metal framework had not been broken, the framework itself was seriously warped. if i can figure out how to add pictures, i'll show before and after.  bottom line: we have several antique lamps. this would be the first and only place we'd go for their repair."
3010,"mike was extremely helpful and honest. he came by to take a look at our garage on the same day that we called. he was there within a very reasonable time for us. we ended up not needing any repairs and were very thankful that he was truthful enough to give us such an opinion. he ensured that our door was functioning properly and safe as it was, and we were fortunate that we did not need any work. we will definitely be seeking his help in the future for any work needed! thank you, mike!"
3011,this is the second time that i have used this company. the first time was for a leak i had in the front yard. the plumber discussed a few different ways to repair the leak (his name was mike). he told me i could patch the pipe or i could replace it with new flexible pipe. i chose to replace it and be done with it. about a week later the same thing happened to my neighbor. my neighbor used city plumbing or something like that and they talked him into making the repair. he has made two more repairs since then. thanks mike for helping me make the right decision!! this time my hot water tank wasn't heating enough. mike came out and replaced the heaters in it and a long rod that prolongs the life of the heater. again mike was on time and did a great job. i will always ask for mike.
3012,called in the morning and they came on time to repair a damage for me at a fair price and quickly.  one of the few places that will pick up your call  late at night.
3013,"team tile and stone just completed our bathroom renovation and they did an excellent job! steve and his team were fantastic. they were very responsive to our requests and some last minute changes that we made. they re-tiled the shower, put in new countertops and sinks, did some drywall work, painted, and added electrical for bathroom wall sconces. they finished on time and were extremely easy to work with! i would highly recommend team tile and stone for your next bathroom project!"
3014,"right now, it's a three, but renovations are in progress that make me believe it will be a five, so i'm giving it a four. the reclining seats are comfortable."
3015,"i was referred to ron at home heros by the monique walker real estate team when i sold my house and had to make some

3020,honest - honest - honest i had four other companies give an estimates to repair my garage door all of them said that i must replace both the door and the garage door opener - i did not want to spend 2k so i kept looking - tyson came out with american veteran garage doors he said that i can repair my door for 150 or replace for 500 - still less than half of what many other companies quoted - i opted to repair - i want to commend this companies honesty which i found to be rare in las vegas. give them a call they might save you $2000. thank you tyson for fixing my garage door.
3021,"i called on thuraday, they arrived within 2 hours. he determined the problem...recommended several options ranging from repair to replacement ($100-$500). we scheduled the replacement package and by 9 am on friday i was being fixed. by 10 am i had a new gucci garage door opener with a fancy gateway for remote access. mike was a great technician and extremely professional. use these guys folks!!!"

3039,"owned by a terribly nice man with a sweet dog and, really, fabulous frames. the perfect not-overwhelming number of options, all wonderfully curated. the basics are here, and plenty of the trendy stuff too, but most with a bit of a twist. a great unique colour, an ornate temple, an astoundingly light material.

a small selection of wooden frames, which were breathtaking. light as a feather and beautiful in colour.

i popped in because my frames needed a quick repair and i work next door - he repaired an arm and replaced a nosepad and then flat out refused to take a cent. 

lots of options for smaller faces. quoted me $450 for three pairs, any i liked, with average strength prescription lenses. not bad!

seriously - a gem - check them out."
3040,"are you serious? now they're vacuuming! these guys are just freaking awesome!!! 

okay, rewind to last week when i found some warm areas in my kitchen tile - too warm for december. turns out we had broken water lines under our slab in several areas and would need to reroute our pipes. this meant several days of cutting holes in the walls, a half day with no water, pipes rerouted, and drywall repairs - ugh!!!

based on the advice of a friend, we called star 5 plumbing. they came out and gave us estimates based on three different scenarios. since we planned to stay in this house for a long time, we opted to have all the pipes rerouted. they were out first thing the following week, showed up on time, and got the job done quickly and efficiently. having this kind of work done to your house is expensive and inconvenient, but star 5 plumbing made it much less stressful!"
3041,"after having kyle perform our home inspection, i can see why every review gives five stars. he was very thorough and clearly knows his stuff. he explained everything in detail and made sure as first-time home buyers we knew what repairs were a big deal and what we could fix ourselves. i would recommend him to anyone looking to get a home inspection in madison. i think his schedule probably fills up fast, so i'd book him the moment you have an accepted offer on a home."
3042,the owner ed and wiley were great. ed really worked with me on the cost of my repair. was a hassle free experience.
3043,"we hired charles golden to repair our chimney and clean out our dryer vent. they did great work, were friendly and professional. they will be our go-to for things like this in the future. we highly recommend them."

3045,"this place is such a great place to go to see a little bit of vegas history.  i didn't realize that you have to buy your ticket ahead of time.  luckily i double checked early and was able to find a late night spot for one a few days ahead of time.   they have quite a few signs here and are always working to repair what they have as well.   as of a few weeks ago, they said they had nine working signs.   our guide was very pleasant and was very informative.   the only downside about this is,  i opted to walk to this place from fremont street by myself, and as i got closer and closer, it started getting sketchier and sketchier.  not in the best of neighborhoods but don't let that deter you from coming here to see history."
3046,"working with envy made our ceiling repair after our roof leak livable! all of the employees were professional, curtious and friendly. i highly recommend envy restrorations and construction!"
3047,"singing the praises of alpha air in a 104degree day for an hvac repair in less than 2 hours from the time i called. normally an hvac response in peak season would take days.  especially on a weekend. he heard the word ""newborn"" and dropped everything. this local owner left his sons 3rd bday party, on his day off, to come through and save the day!   you've got top yelp ratings for a reason sir and you've got a customer for life!"
3048,this is a great place for hiking. the kids like it here. the area is in a little disrepair and needs updating from the nps. otherwise this is a great area to hike and picnic

3050,"i needed an electrician to troubleshoot my garage outdoor fixture and landscape floods --all of which were not working.  jeff accommodated my work schedule by setting a time to meet me at 6pm.  he called around 5:15 to advise me he would be about a half hour later which was fine with me, and i appreciated his letting me know in plenty of time.  he was able to repair all fixtures in about an hour and for a very reasonable price.  jeff is professional and polite. i have no hesitation in recommending him highly."
3051,"thank you guys for sending your professional plumber, it was an urgent request when i called but the person who took my call assured me that they will send someone over right away to do the repair. i was surprised by their fast respond time! and no more leaking water!"
3052,"called steve, owner if diamond roofing, for an estimate on a new roof for my mothers 
sun city home. he spent a great deal of time going over everything that needed to be done and what my options where. i already knew the quaility if the work,as he had roofed about six homes on her street. a crew showed up on a monday and by late tuesday there was a beautiful new roof,complete with all needed repairs and extra whirybird vents and a new skylight. let me say that i am a picky person about home repairs and i think that they did a fantastic job.

3056,real helpful staff and good turn around times. have had my 7.3l worked on here multiple times from major repair to routine maintenance and they do good work each time. they helped fabricate a speciality fuel neck for my trucks unique flatbed setup within my budget too.
3057,"i'm a huge diy guy and love to spend my free time upgrading my home. i can be found at my local home depot at least once a weekend (if i'm lucky). they literally have everything i could possibly need. as of late, i am doing a kitchen renovation. simple stuff: refinishing cabinets, updating the sink and faucet, lighting, etc. all of which i can and have handled myself. next step on the list was a new countertop. one of which all the research in the world could not make me feel comfortable with handling myself. ha. granite? quartz? corian? all i know is that anything will be better than my current laminate situation. i was referred to kim at this location and was told that she is the best at what she does. so i set an appointment and went in on this past friday. i have been borderline obsessed with one of the countertop styles for a while now. ok, i've been totally obsessed. and it was time to bite the bullet. i met with kim, who was in fact just as great as i was told. she was friendly, knowledgeable and seemed just as excited for my upgrade as i was. some things should just be left to the experts. install will take place 2 weeks from now after fabrication is complete. i simply cannot wait! if you're looking to upgrade your countertops, go see kim! she's pretty awesome. update to follow."

3061,"saturday night our ac broke, causing us to suffer in the hot summer heat the next day. i was hesitant to contact ac repairmen since it was a sunday and we had to use our home warranty, as we had just bought the house. i spoke with mike via the yelp app and he reassured me that they had dealt with warranties before and he'd be glad to come over and help us with our ac. he showed up shortly after the call, super nice guy, very professional and he went right to work. found the problem was our capacitor. he was quick to fix it and saved our butts from the hot summer heat! made the paperwork easy to fill out and the home warranty was no problem! thank you!!!! definitely recommend!!!"

3067,this is a beautiful old rink in west toronto. the exterior could use a renovation but the inside of the building is a classic hockey arena. the staff do a great job keeping the arena clean and organized. the george bell hockey league is run out of this arena as well and is one of the best run kid's leagues in the city from our experience.
3068,"being new to the area, i trust yelp for its recommendations. i needed a ceiling fan installed in my living room so i called various handymen and electricians. rio electric offered a very competitive price and was prompt in their scheduling. ryan and his crew came on time as well as installed my fan promptly and professionally. after the installation, ryan and his team made sure to tidy up their work area. i am very impressed with their work and highly recommend rio electric for all your electrical needs."
3069,"i contacted scott to repair my yamaha scooter. he's not the fastest responder in the world, but incredible conscientious and fair with this work. he ended up making 3 visits - diagnosed the first visit, but needed a part, then turned out something else was wrong, so needed to order a new part. he bought the first part from me since it was his mistake, then didn't charge for the additional visit. all in all, i was very impressed and would recommend him to any one."
3070,"don is one of the most honest, intelligent hvac repair guys i have experienced at my home.  he responds to calls promptly and is on time.  i highly recommend using him for all your hvac needs."
3071,"will use again if i need a handyman and will definitely recommend them to my friends. reasonably priced, super friendly and easy to talk to. they were able to come the same day and did a great job."
3072,"hired troy for some general handyman work around the house recently, mostly stuff i have no talent or desire to do; put in new garbage disposal, hang towel rack, put on door threshold, etc. etc. troy's very consciences about his work, and very diligent.  he even saved me money on the new garbage disposal!  thanks troy!"
3073,"steve/diamond roofing did an outstanding job on our residence and detached garage. first came the initial visit/estimate. steve was very thorough on the inspection, pointing out all the areas that required some special attention. the estimate was very competitive. we made the decision to go with diamond roofing over other estimates we received. diamond was not the lowest, and not the highest!. 
prior to the work starting, (total tear-off, repair of any wood defects), steve made another visit, rechecking all areas. 
workers showed up on time, as scheduled. work done was, in my opinion, excellent. the required/necessary damaged wood was replaced, including some rotted facia boards/wrongly installed drip-edge.
new roof looks fantastic, extra vents were needed/recommended, and added. (our detached garage had no vents prior to this install!) new vents on the garage has certainly made a difference in the inside garage temperatures!
thanks steve and diamond roofing..."
3074,"this review is long overdue.. billy is absolutely amazing at what he does. any time i need a guitar set up, i go here to get it done right and wouldn't go anywhere else. hands down the best place in the valley to go for your setups, repairs, etc!"
3075,"i can't be critical of this lowe's. i visit it multiple times per week and have consistently pleasurable experiences. the staff is affable and knowledgeable, willing to provide guidance for handymen of any skill level. not sure what the negative reviews are all about. and as for the comparison to hd, the 2 closest hd's are filthy in comparison but staff at both lowes and hd are busy bees, albeit often very willing to assist."
3076,"thank you soooo much. prior to calling you we called one hour air conditioning to come look at our unit. they said they couldn't fix it and that we needed a new unit which would cost $7500. bs! 
best air conditioning repair came, fixed it in less then 1/2 hour and for under $200 and it's working great. thank you. will definitely recommend."
3077,"when i called my home warranty company for plumbing repair, they said they were sending catania & son plumbing.  i quickly looked them up on yelp to see the reviews.  i was happy to see 5-start reviews.  they were nice and capable.  the job was done right and done quickly.  after the work was done, they made sure to clean up.  not only they are very skilled (trust me, hard to find a good plumber!), but they are very friendly.  like other reviewer said, they came across as very honest and trustworthy.  i'm glad my home warranty company uses catania & son plumbing."
3078,"alex and his crew did an incredible job. they repaired our stucco fence, and painted the house. they look brand new! alex is honest, responsive, and reasonable; he is very good to work with. plus, he got the job done quickly. i will definitely recommend him to anyone looking to have their house painted."
3079,"one of my top choices for pizza in mississauga. friendly owner and staff, excellent pizza and topping. these folks do it right just the right amount of sauce on top of their delicious multi crust dough. also the place had gone through a renovation recently, very nice."
3080,"they do good work.  sometimes the staff seems a bit disorganized, but overall the end result is very good.  price isn't cheap, but seems to be top quality as both of my repairs held up well.  the repair was done as promised in just over an hour."
3081,"troy is definitely a quality handyman, who i have called several times with questions.
he also did some significant repairs for my home before it was sold. he was able to quote the job promptly and completed it just as quick. 

i think very highly of troy because of his honesty and work ethic. he won my business after the job he did on my first home and now i call him if there is any issue i cannot tackle myself. i know he super busy because of his yelp following which could lead to the unreturned calls.

the only part i wasn't completely thrilled with is the time it took to finally pay him. it did take a couple weeks to finally complete payment. again my guess is out of sight out of mind. 

regardless i would recommend troy at tks to anyone looking for a handyman here in the valley!"
3082,"this review is for the parts & accessories department, not repair or sales. this place has an unusually good inventory of different and/or hard to find parts. the staff is also very helpful as well- if they don't have what you need, they'll help you find it or get it for you. check 'em out!"
3083,thanks steve for helping me pick the sprinkler parts i needed for my repair. i appreciate you taking the time to help coach me through the process.  this lady definitely needed lots of guidance

3085,"terry mcshane is a highly personable, skilled, and professional luthier who does not hesitate spending time explaining and demonstrating what your violin needs to have repaired.  i would recommend arizona fine violins without hesitation to anyone, and will definitely continue trekking out there despite it being quite the distance from where i live."
3086,"wouldn't go to anyone but mike. fast, professional, 100% successful repair, done right the first time."
3087,"on two separate occasions, mark's has repaired damaged luggage (thank you aa) as warranty work, without any hassle!  the staff is very personable and professional.  we highly recommend mark's."
3088,"safelite has always been awesome just had a repair done by william and he did great!!!! i had minor cracks and now i can't even see them. i definitely will recommend them always they are so prompt emails are sent out with pictures of the techs, they also send email reminders with the times against so you don't forget."
3089,"after being screwed over by a local credit repair company, it was great to meet an honest man in the business. he was very knowledgable about the field. he looked over our credit in detail and was honest with us that that our credit was something he could not fix.  it was great to hear honesty in this credit repair business because every scam artist out there will tell you they can take off things off your credit report when they can't.  would highly recommend going to harry jacobs at credit restoration of nevada.  you can expect professionalism and honesty."
3090,after a horrible experience with the yes man can ac repair i called air wizards to help me out. i am so glad i did. bill is a class act and very easy to work with. they replaced my ac unit at a fraction of the cost i was quoted from the other company. they were very professional and did an amazing job fixing our ac. we couldn't be happier and i will definately call them with any of my ac or heating needs. i highly recommend them if you want an honest professional company.
3091,"unfortunately, i've dealt with many a/c-heating repair companies in the past and alpha air is by far the best. why? artur (the owner) is fair, honest, on time and professional. what more can you ask for?"
3092,"i have been getting repairs, tune-ups, parts and supplies here for 12 years.  the owner, terry, is a genuinely nice person and doesn't price gouge.  a pleasure to do business with."
3093,"i read the reviews and thought i'd give almeida a try. their estimate came way lower than the other companies i contacted (from angie's list). almeida was punctual, professional, and communicated effectively. when successive monsoon storms blew away some of the roofing as the work was being done, they came in early the day after each storm to make necessary repairs and complete the job. i am very impressed with this company and i highly recommend them!"
3094,i called and spoke to keith a week ago and got an estimate on my washer. when i was ready for the repair he gave me an appointment with his son chris. he was very helpful and attentive. he was quick and honest about what was wrong and needed to be repaired. i have read other reviews on the company and can not relate to any negative reviews. they were professional and i recommend that you give them a call and judge for yourself. the repair came with a 3 month warranty. something no one else offered. we were extremely happy and relieved to have our washer up and running again. and for future repairs we will definitely be calling this company.
3095,"was leary of these guys because of reviews,had to deal with them because of extended  warranty work on our mom's washer. we had a repairman named kevin who was great! can't say enough good things about him. thanks for all your help kevin we appreciate it. keep up the good work.   jeff ginster"
3096,"quick, easy and painless process.  august accommodated my tough schedule without a hitch.  we actually had additional repairs needed, and given the nature he recommended us another contractor that did great work as well.  will use again when necessary."
3097,if you are going to buy apple product buy it from here. not best buy. best buy is not authorized to repair you apple product only apple certified repairs can repair apple products.
3098,"if you have any projects at your home, tj and howardpro should be your first call! he has installed light fixtures, electrical outlets, recessed lighting, roof repairs and more at our home. he is always on time, cleans his work area when he's done, and works harder than any person i've ever hired to do work. he won't let you down!"
3099,i'm so grateful for sierra air and wayne e!!!  we purchased a 22 year old home and knew the a/c was old so i wasn't surprised when our house wouldn't cool down this week.   my husband contacted sierra air and they scheduled a technician to come out the next day.  wayne was so friendly and examined all the equipment.  he explained to me everything that was going on with our system.   he gave us options from just adding coolant to repairs to a new unit.  he wasn't pushy about selling us a new unit but did show us pictures of the system in our attic and it is pretty clear our unit needs to go see jesus.  the experience made it easy to trust them and we will be purchasing a new unit through them soon.
3100,"i used jim desio to help me find a renter for my house in henderson.  i live out of state, and i have to say that jim went above and beyond to secure a good renter for me.  he helped me find reasonable repair people to get the house cleaned up and was always professional and accessible.  it's really important to find someone you feel you can trust, especially when you are not able to be there to oversee things."
3101,"i had a really expensive quote from another ac company for a massive rip-and-repair of existing ductwork and an old ac unit, so i wanted a second opinion.  kevin was prompt, professional, and smartly suggested just replacing some crushed ducts to fix the hot rooms before doing anything else.  doing incremental work to see how much it helps before the massive repairs was appreciated and much more cost effective.  he also took the time to measure the current/power draw on my older ac unit to see how well it is performing to its seer rating.  highly recommend kevin for any hvac work!"
3102,correction of prior review.  the company that i thought i was reviewing was az quick response garage door repair.  my apologies.
3103,"the ac in my x5 was failing. for most of this year, i was able to deal with it as it was just cool enough. however, when i had to roll down my windows for some of that arizona blow-dryer in your face type wind, i decided it was time for a repair. here's where gene comes in. he fixed it - fast, and cost effectively."
3104,simple irrigation repairs and question. total integrity and problem solving so as to save me money. on time and courteous.
3105,"i'm late with my review but k&j windows installed all new dual pain windows and arcadia doors in our home i july. they were professional and great communicators (from our first contact with cody, estimate from tony, jeb's installation and follow up with jessica). we had an issue with one window trim and they sent someone out within a few days to repair it. love our windows! highly recommend them!"
3106,"i stopped by today to have the clasp on my husband's necklace chain repaired. tom was able to fix it within a minute, even though he was doing some other work, and was extremely kind and helpful as my young kids ran circles around me. he made my day! i will definitely be returning here for any repairs that i need."
3107,"thanks for all your help with the roof repair, i really appreciate it. you guys made it super simple. i definitely be recommending you to anyone with roof issues."
3108,"had edgar come out to do a warranty repair.  very efficient, professional, and on time. i look forward to using them for a personal repair the next time some dies out."
3109,"even though i live in san diego, i try to save the big repairs for when i visit family in phoenix. that way i can take my mazda 3 to cathedral. i trust shane and his crew to do the job right and give me a square deal. they just replaced my broken ac compressor, saving me a couple of hundred dollars over quotes in sd. gotta love that!"
3110,"i cannot say enough positive things about this company if i tried to. they were fast, honest, upfront, and most of all didn't try to rip me off or overcharge me. they were reasonable, friendly, and to be honest by the way i was treated i felt like family. if you need a plumbing repair, call here first. you won't be disappointed."
3111,"jeremy and his highly compete crew did an outstanding job on our solid granite 3/4 inch thick counter tops.  we did a renovation and changed out the stove top and the sink.  the new stove top required enlarging the existing cut out in our granite counter.  his crew built a plastic 'tent' to minimize the fine dust from cutting the granite.  then they expertly cut the opening to the proper size for the new stove top, which now fits perfectly.

the sink was (in my opinion) a more difficult job.  it required enlarging the existing opening, but also including small radius corners.  once finished, they polished the freshly cut edge, so the opening for the under-mount sink looks as beautiful as the original finish on our granite.

i found jeremy and his crew very easy to work with.  would absolutely use them again."
3112,"if you need a handyman that does a high class job this is the end of the line. i have had him do numerous jobs at my house. install windows, french doors, paint, electrical work and plumbing jobs. jamison does an outstanding job. his attention to detail sets him above all the other handymen i have hired over the years.

if you want something fixed, installed, or a custom project you have dreamed up. this is the man for the job."
3113,charged $69.95 to come out. did the repair to my clothes dryer and all my wife paid was 69.95.
3114,i have been using troy for many years now. he is the most polite and honest person you could ever wish to meet. it takes a lot to impress me since i am in the construction trade. he really knows his stuff. i have used him and recommended him in the past and will continue to do so. troy is my go to guy when i myself am in need or a friend is in need of a true handyman.
3115,"sheraton station square has stood the test of time, and gone thru a number of renovations over the years.  great views of the river and downtown from that side.  

huge open lobby area, with a bar and restaurant in front of the windows."
3116,"excellent meal. i had two courses and extra side dishes paired with wine and the bill was still less than what i had anticipated. really creative dishes from the chef, using fresh local ingredients. the portions were a little too generous so i had to take some leftovers home! we're thinking of hosting an event here now. i think their bathroom is under renovations though, the door didn't close."
3117,"you know that sinking feeling? it's 113 degrees outside when your air conditioner has stopped working? 

my husband was out of town, i don't know sqaut about an air conditioning, and i'm dreading the news that i have to buy a new one? 

at the recommendation of a friend, i called jim at bumble bee and he was able to fit me in that afternoon. thank god!

i know that this is shocking, but there actually is a heating and air conditioning company in town that is ...ready? honest!

jim tested my capacitor (my neighbor had checked for everything else, so jim didn't have to do a lot of testing on the unit)  and the capacitor had failed. he replaced it and added some freon.

i was slightly surprised by my bill, which was $280, because my neighbor had told me that a capacitor is a relatively inexpensive part ($25-$50), but i do believe jim to be honest and capable..and who wants to argue that when it's 113 degrees?


this is the company to call for honest repair and sales!"
3118,abel was extraordinary! he went above and beyond paying attention to detail and he did everything in a fraction of the time as other big companies were quoting. i wish he was close to our new home. he would be our handyman for life!
3119,awesome family-owned business.  always show up on time and perform reliable repairs.
3120,"this place is amazing! friendly, affordable, conveniently located and very good at repairs. i've been to three cobblers in the city, and this is by far the best."
3121,great location and not that busy which is a plus. i have been coming here about once a week because of house renovations. the staff is super friendly and checking out is a breeze!
3122,jay came out and repaired a few parts in my ac unit in a very timely manner. we were lucky enough that he able to come by after hours because our ac wasn't blowing cool air. he was very proficient and professional and i'll always request him in the future.
3123,"i needed some drywall repairs in my home. this was my first time needing this type of work in the las vegas area, so i searched this site and found armando with twins drywall. armando made a 7am appointment with me. he arrived on time and went straight to work. he did an excellent job and i would recommend twins drywall & paint solutions to anyone. thanks, armando!"
3124,"i had my acne treatment here two years before, i had acne all over my face at that time, the treatment had a scientific process to help to reduce the acne and repair the skin. you only need to follow the instruction anna gives to you and do regular peels."
3125,"i had a very positive experience with howardpro! right from the start, their communication was fast, friendly, and pressure-free. when scheduling the appointment, they went above and beyond to accommodate my schedule. when he arrived, tj was friendly and polite. he explained to me what he was doing and worked efficiently, wasting no time. a real honest, hard working, and reasonably-priced professional. i'm happy to finally have a go-to handyman now! highly recommended."

3127,i had some challenging requirements for the home i wanted to buy. sharyn searched and made herself available anytime something came up that might be the right house. we eventually found it and i ended up buying it for $9000 under asking price and sharyn got the seller to help with my closing costs. way better than i expected. after i moved in i had a couple of problems with the house and sharyn was there to help me figure out my home warranty and find really good repair people. i know she'll be there to answer any house related questions and to help me buy my next house. she's awesome.
3128,"mike is honest and dependable.  he showed up early and fixed my door fast.  i thought the door needed to be replaced, but he explained that he could repair it for now, didn't need replacing yet.  he also explained the problem thoroughly, and made some other adjustments.  good deal, glad i didn't try to fix it on my own!"
3129,"great prices. clinton had to mail it to me after repairs, but did so the same day!"
3130,"had them out via american home shield for a repair. 
they recommended a new unit and were able to do it quickly and saved me lots of money vs. 2 other quotes. they did an excellent job.

my only complaint was that they did not test the furnace they installed as part of the package. i pointed this out to the head installer as he was packing out and he said why bother since it was april.

huh? 
that did not set well with me. i buy something. you install it. you test it by turning it on before you leave. period.

 they only get 4 stars because of that."
3131,i have been getting repairs and tune-ups here for 11 years.  a pleasure to do business with.
3132,"we originally had twins come in and remove some wall mirrors and repair and paint the drywall underneath. on-time, expedient and excellent work!!!

cannot wait for them to return and quote us on a complete interior paint job after we have our floors replaced.

thank you.!!!"
3133,i appreciate the this company as they go above and beyond for us everytime! they always know what needs to be done and are very thorough and clean. i trust them with all of my electrical needs. i also needed some drywall repair and plumbing work done and their referrals were top notch.
3134,i use troy's for all my pop-up head repairs. they have helped me out with some of my most high profile clients. they just get it done. very appriciative.
3135,"i had some roof damage due to a storm that hit in early august.  the damage caused internal garage damage, or so i thought.  jp from rocky mountain restoration came out and inspected the area, determined that there was no true water damage so there was no need for repair.  the inspection was free and i really appreciate his professionalism and his honesty.  

i had used rocky mountain restoration a couple years ago for water damage at another property and they did a great job, so i reached out to them for this situation and i am glad i did.  highly recommend them!"
3136,"we had two repair people come out to see why my dishwasher wasn't draining. the last person said there was some glass in the drain. he said he got it all out but really didn't. garrett came out today and took his time to really figure out the issue and found more stuff in the drain. he didn't rush, was very professional and highly recommend this company!"
3137,"this is the place with the giant lizard mural on lemon. it used to be really run down, but they've done a ton of renovations over the last year and it is like new. i really like how things turned out, especially the polished concrete floors and the kitchen. doesn't hurt that it's right down the street from asu."
3138,got a quote from ky-ko for tile roof repairs.  they were one of the most reasonable and showed up on time and got the job done.  we had been going round and round with several other companies just to get estimates.  they did a great job and the roof has held up well with the heavy rains of 2014.
3139,"these are your go to guys! cheerful, friendly, these guys are the real deal. the pricing they gave us was better than 3 other people we contacted. they came same day. they stayed in touch on exactly what was needed to be removed. i was surprised that they loaded all of the green waste and some renovations waste i didn't even expect them to take. highly recommended."
3140,"my ge water softener sprung a leak a week or so ago so i called them for repairs. doug came out to assess the situation and determined the problem. parts were ordered and joe came out today to finish the repair and reconnect. both gentlemen were courteous and straight forward. i recommend this company as they are water softener experts, and they honor what they promise."
3141,"there's a reason they get 5 stars! i have been a customer for many years and they are the best, most honest people you will ever meet. if they should make a mistake on a repair, they always make it right, although that rarely happens. if you want a guy you can trust, go to shane's"
3142,"these guys are professional and affordable!

we did a ceiling drywall repair in our kitchen but were reluctant to try to match the texture. armando came out the day after we called, gave us a very reasonable bid for the texture and fit us into their schedule the same week even though they were busy. their willingness to do a partial job was awesome; many contractors will not do that. the texture matches perfectly. you can't even tell there was a repair.

they were very clean, draping everything including the floor in and out of the house. these guys get a++"
3143,;air dynamics is a company of their word.  i called on the worst day of the year 122 degrees and they were the only company out of four that responded to my call after 6 pm.  they came out right away but made an error on the estimate and stood by their original quote to repair my ac compressor.  another issue occurred that the labeling on my ac housing was incorrect and the wrong compressor got installed and would not cool properly.  they came out right away and installed the right compressor without hesitation.  not to many companies stand by their reputation and fix errors that are costly.  this company is  a+++ in my book.
3144,"needed the small metal clasp on my $200 heels replaced after it broke off. my mom recommended this place after she had a good experience getting a boot buckle repaired for $5. i dropped off my heels and picked them up a couple hours later. only cost me $8. quick, easy, and got the job done. just what i was looking for."
3145,"this is actually a great restaurant but i fear they will be closing soon if they do not do some much needed renovations. this restaurant is so big, and quite dated, with all the new restaurants opening in southpark that are smaller and more small plates style, mccormick's is going to have to do some re-branding in order to stay in business."
3146,"we needed our stem wall repaired and i found some good reviews for tennyson. lee and his staff were great. he was quick to respond to all emails, flexible, and showed up on time. he gave a fair price, completed the job in 2.5 days (finished on a sat), and left the place just as he found it. thanks for the help."
3147,called bumble bee when i woke up to a 90 degree home. repairman showed up within a few hours after call. after asking me a few questions about what was happening he had found the issue and repaired it within 30 minutes. i was happy to find out that the issue was not that big and not that expensive. never once did he try to fix anything else or sell me on upgrades. but he answered all my questions when i asked about preventive maintenance. i would highly recommend bumblebee to anybody with ac issues. i will have to let you use them for all my future issues.
3148,"delicious dumplings - looks kind of rundown from the outside but once you go inside, the renovations make for a somewhat pleasant atmosphere."
3149,"i walked in scraping and gouging out holes from the broken bottom heel of my stiletto's & walked out with a full-stride with their quick & inexpensive repair!

convenient location for central charlotte."
3150,"this is the second repair that dave has done for me. first slider i let go do long that he had to put in a new track.  it has never worked better!  this year i had dave go to my son's home. this was even more difficult. because of settling dave had difficulty getting the slider door out. he reworked the track so it didn't have to be replaced. dave spent a lot of time at this job and even put in double wheels for stability. 
all for a $160. dave is a straight shooter that i would strongly recommend!"
3151,"my new job on this site should be to alert people as to when restaurants are closed lol. last week i walked to dukem in the freezing cold to find out they were closed until further notice. today, i am finding out sher-e-punjab is closed as well. they are doing renovations until march 10. other than that, i love this place."
3152,austin and brandon at american construction & renovation are as good and honest as it gets! their responsiveness from asking for a quote to getting the job done is unparalleled. i was literally able to get austin out to my property the day after asking him for a quote. he then delivered the quote to me the same evening and was able to begin and complete the work the following week. their quote was fair and the work was quality. thanks guys for not only a job well done but also for making the process so easy.
3153,"we used alan's air when our a/c needed to be replaced and we couldn't be happier.  when our rental house a/c had a problem in mid-summer, they were there to repair it the same day. the owner, alan, is honest and very easy to work with.  we won't call anyone else if we need a a/c company."
3154,"az eddy's is my air conditioner repair/maintenance guy for life.  i've been using them consistently for about 3 years now, and usually work with bob, and i have absolutely never been disappointed.

i needed them to come out asap to fix my ac in the middle of an az summer (over 100 degrees of course) with two kids and a wife at home  -- he came out promptly the next day early in the morning.

these guys (or is it one guy?) are very honest - they will not overcharge you even if given the chance.  i have even assumed that more repairs were required, i.e. new freon, but he assured me that this was not the case, it was some other fix that didn't end up costing me anything."
3155,"wow what can i say about skystone creations. my friend is visiting from california and needed some repairs to her indian jewelry, so glad we found skystone. they are so professional and helpful with so much knowledge. they did the repairs while we waited perfectly. i can't say enough about skystone, you will not be disappointed. if you need to buy a gift or something for yourself they have the most beautiful selection. thank you, thank you."
3156,we had a great experience at our home inspection with doug. doug was thorough and full of great advice. he even gave us some tips for upkeep and repairs. the report was very organized and detailed with clear photos. doug is easy to talk to and the price for the inspection was average.
3157,needed a window chip repair and will was happy to accommodate! he was efficient and did a great job making sure it won't spread any further.
3158,"i've used many plumbing companies and mesa plumbing is the best i've come across.  i had significant repairs done in two bathrooms and everything was completed in one day.  the work done was outstanding and they used quality products, all at a very reasonable price!!!   paul was my plumber and he did a fantastic job.  he's a true professional and his experience showed in his attention to detail and the quality of his work. he definitely knows the plumbing business. my wife and i couldn't be happier with him or mesa plumbing.   if you need a plumber,  i recommend mesa plumbing. they are reliable, honest, and will do the job right."
3159,"these guys were on time, clean, professional and based on past experience with another company they didn't inflate the repair cost.
i personally will not call anyone else. it's hard to find a honest repair company in this city and i am very happy to find these guys."
3160,came over in 1/2 hour and did repair with parts on the truck. other company wanted to charge a trip charge  and  40% more for the same repair. total savings 55%  and repair done correctly and promptly.
3161,"it was very easy to remove & install the timer with the help of the video. sent the part out, the repair was fast and it is working perfect.  i saved hundreds of dollars by using this site instead of a local repairman that quoted me more the triple the price. i highly recommend this site."
3162,very efficient process from estimate through repair.  no surprises & repairs were completed on time.  the staff i worked with were professional and communications were thorough & timely.  excellent experience.

i had the horn go out and the lights also had issues. it was inexpensive for the lights and eh horn they covered for free. 

the scooter has been knocked over by other motorcyclists parking but avanti gave me a fee estimate for repairs."

3166,they did a great job with our condo renovations; our kitchen and bathroom counter tops look great!
3167,"i had a great experience with flores, as easy and pleasant as having your air conditioner go out can be.  miguel answered my call and was available to come out right away.  he went straight to work and repaired my ac within an hour or so, and the bill was shockingly reasonable.  i was prepared to have to haggle about upsells and extra charges, but there was no need.  i'm very glad i read these reviews and made the call, if i ever have future heating/air troubles, flores will be the place i use."
3168,his work was done with great satisfaction! his price was very competitive compare with the other handymen who contacted me.  i would definitely recommend him! in addition he was very kind and courteous.----tony
3169,"javier showed up on short notice and on time.  he gave the most competitive estimate.  he came in shy of his estimate to our delight.
he was professional with excellent results and references for our retaining wall repairs.

3170,"excellent work!  the technician who came to my house, for a follow-up visit on my home warranty, was friendly and professional.   he didn't complain about having to repair items that were ignored by another repair company earlier in the week, he completed the requested work in a timely manner."
3171,"action air is the best a/c firm you will ever find.  we have used them for years. one of our a/c units went out friday am before labor day.  they offered to come friday but we asked them to come saturday.  no problem they said.  sure enough they arrived at 8:15 on saturday am of labor day weekend.  located blown fuse and low coolant and repaired within one hour.  folks, it just does not get any better than that."

3174,"troy has done a number of projects for me ranging from painting a building to some light wall repairs.  every time a new project comes up i think i am going to call him and stump him with something he, ""can't do"". 

i am still waiting for that response.  most other tradesmen i have ever met are driven strictly by how much money they can make and how fast they can complete the job to move on to the next project.  troy is super obsessive about customer satisfaction.  after your project is complete expect him to follow up several times to make sure you are completely, 100% satisfied."
3175,fast cheap and easy to deal with. had my repairs done while i waited. i was in and done in 15 minutes without the hassle of going to a loud crowded mall. happy to spend dollars at a local place.
3176,can't be beat i love this place. just a good old school vegas hangout . not too many left in town. from what i understand they just went through a recent renovation so the place looks fresh and clean.
3177,"beautiful setting and grounds for a red roof and having doggie ""poop bags"" was a definite plus.

the room itself was pretty decent with the exception of the entry door which was bent and initially impossible to get in.  the front desk was aware of it and told me how to get it open...seriously in need of repair.

i only stay at red roof properties when i travel with my dogs because the chain is consistently dog friendly, but nothing else about the inns themselves is consistent ...


update 7/2015
seems to have actually gotten better since i was here last summer!"
3178,"what a great treasure located in gastonia nc. i think i probably resound my fellow contributors: its all about the planetarium. they have an amazing collection of taxidermy on display. i think most of the collection has seen its age.

the schiele is currently under renovation and is extending. i'm very curious what will be added. on a good day, i highly recommend taking a walk on their trails and experience a catawba village. there's much more to see outside."
3179,"these guys were awesome. it was a simple repair however they were here within a few minutes, fixed it in no time, and wouldn't take my money. don't waste your time calling anyone else. had to force $10 on them for their time. should have gave them more but i'm cheap. i would not hesitate to call them again if needed. thanks guys."
3180,"i contracted absolute perfection to repair a leaky roof at our home in charlotte,  scot was very detailed in describing the repair required and provided a quote that was specific for the work to be done.  i obtained estimated from several other roofing companies and scot's was competitive- not the cheapest and not the most expensive.  i decided to use him because he provided a detailed quote describing exactly what was to be done.  the work was done as promised and the leak is fixed.  i would use absolute perfection, and scot, again for future work."

3182,we called definitive to do some preventative maintenance on our ac unit. we didn't require major repairs and mike was honest and up front about it - he didn't try to sell us on any extras like you hear other companies try to do. hope to spread the word that we finally found a trustworthy contractor!

3185,"thank you mark and wayne for an awesome job! mark you were spot on with the probable cause and necessary repair. wayne you were a power house in 100+ degree weather...tyler here's a shout out for you too! for homeowners, like myself who will be checking these reviews (as i did), after my water bill triped, i called yes. mark and wayne responded and although it was a costly repair (hello it's plumbing), i am overly happy with the finished job, the professionalism (wayne) and the work ethic...really awesome people!"
3186,"ryan is extremely thorough and professional with his inspections. he takes his time and checks every inch of the house to ensure nothing is missed. he treated my home as if it were his own, providing impeccable knowledge and advice on all home maintenance and repairs. he also answered any and all questions in a completely understanding way. he is trustworthy, reliable, and punctual. this made what could have been a stressful home buying experience very pleasant for us. call him soon, he is in high demand!! thank you greenlight!"

3189,"i really was impressed!  a genuine honest owner who actually made a small repair to our filter door cover when he gave is the estimate on a new unit.  estimate was very competitive on a high quality unit and the owner was on site for the install.  in a marketplace full of big companies, you will do way better to let these guys do your next hvac work.  five stars was not enough!"
3190,"fast, affordable, great quality of repairs! hopefully won't have to return, but i know where to go if need be. ;)"

3193,dan showed up when he said he would and repaired my garage door quickly and efficiently. he could have up-sold me to a bigger job but he saved me 85% by doing a repair. it's as good as new.
3194,"i needed 2 tiles after a recent storm.  the tile on my house is no longer available.   another company quoted $500 to replace just 2 tiles.  kevin and another fellow (sorry - i didn't get his name) from almeida roofing found matching tiles.  they came out and not only replaced the tiles, but also repaired another area for a very reasonable price.  i am grateful for the repairs and will call almeida when i need a new roof."
3195,"steve and his crew did a terrific job on our house. they were patient with us as we choose colors and had some improvements completed that had to be painted. they made repairs to my stucco, and they always cleaned up after they were finished for the day.i recommended them to several family members and neighbors and they all had great experiences too!"
3196,eric was prompt and professional. he installed 2 ceiling fans in no time and made recommendations for future repairs. i wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend him to friends and family.
3197,noble painting is a great company to work with and they stand by their warranty. i had them repair a badly water damaged stucco fence and paint it for me. there were a few minor issues a year later. i contacted kenny and they came right out to repair a few cracks and repaint. i wish all companies stood behind their warranties the way noble painting does. the crews that came to work were knowlegable about what needed to be done.  they cleaned up and were respectful of my yard. they were thorough and my fence looks amazing. i recently had other contractors in my yard  bidding on some landscaping work. two of them complimented my stucco walls and asked who did them. if you want quality work and someone who will take you through the project explaining the steps and what needs to be done then choose kenny and noble painting.
3198,great staff at jt temperature! they were recommended to me by one of their customers and i will do the same to anyone in need of a/c repair. they are fast in their response time and efficient in their work.
3199,"when my dishwasher quit working, i was really afraid that i was looking at a costly repair or have to wait for a long time, but none of that happened. when i called, i was told they could come out same day; there would be a $49.95 charge for the estimate, but that it would be waived if i used them for the repair.  mike, our repairman was here within the hour and he fixed our dishwasher in under an hour.  he also tok the time to explain how we could avoid having a similar problem in the future.  all in all, i really like them over sears whose usual wait is between five days to a week and cost was more reasonable as well."
3200,"stan was nothing short of exceptional when fixing my cabinets in the kitchen. 

1.) he was on time 

2.) i only needed him to fix 5 of them and he went ahead and fixed them all.

3.) he was friendly, professional, and fair for his pricing

i will recommend him to all my friends and family. if you're reading this and have something that needs to be fixed.. do yourself a favor and call stan the handyman!"
3201,mike is very honest and committed to doing a great job. i brought my daughter's ipad mini to him to be repaired and am beyond happy with the outcome. he is very good with communication and will do whatever it takes to keep customers happy!
3202,"i have a 12-year-old home with great windows, but three of them are broken. it happens fast with seven kids. i called these guys and they informed me that i would be better with a trade partner of theirs as they primarily replace all the windows in the home as opposed to repair windows. the conversation save me a lot of time and they referred me to a great organization. props"
3203,"i used aguilar ac in 2016 before and they did an excellent job. then i had another problem in 2017, when  i was out of the state.  they came and fixed the ac units. i had a minor repair needed this year and i am so glad that i found a aguilar ac and heating on yelp.com because they are awesome probably one of the best resources i have ever found on yelp"

3205,"i was reffered to mark's luggage by tumi as an authorized repair location.  i sent my very old tumi bag in for a repair.  once they received it tim called me to give me a few options.  i chose to have the bag overhauled and i have to say for a very nominal price, they did a wonderful job!  they even included a garmet bag that had long been lost.

tim is the best!!!"
3206,fyi:  dumpling house is closed for renovations from november 1 - 30th.  had a craving for dumplings last night but found it was closed :(
3207,highly recommended!  bill was very professional and knew what he was doing.  we called him to repair our heater.  the previous hvac company recommended that we replace the unit or repair for a substantially higher price.  we called air wizards for a second opinion.  he said we needed to replace a part and he got it done the same day and for way less!  i am surprised at all the one star review here because he was very professional and honest.  we're glad we called him for a second opinion.  we will call him again in the future!
3208,definitely recommend without a doubt!!! showed up in about an hour and made same day repairs with all work completed within about an hour and a half. thoroughly and honestly explained everything and even though it was well into his evening chris kept a sense of humor and an amazing personality. can't rave enough about this experience and i'm a tough customer lol thanks chris!!!! you are amazing at what you do!
3209,"andre is simply the best. my wife and i were first-time home buyers. after a lot of research on realtors, we decided to go with andre after reading online reviews from his customers who expressed how patient he was. now that we've gone through the process and found our dream house, here are the reasons why we loved working with andre: 

1) patient - andre is beyond patient. finding a home in toronto in this market takes a lot of time and energy and andre was always ready to go look at another house. not once did we ever feel any pressure from andre to make an offer, etc 

2) responsive - he answered our calls/texts/emails within minutes. he was always available 

3) positive - sometimes looking for a home can be frustrating and andre always reassured us that he would find the right home for us -- and he was right. we found the perfect place.

4) knowledgeable -  this was the thing that set him apart. andre knows a lot about how much money it costs to renovate homes (because he has multiple properties himself). as a result, you sort of get a home inspector/contractor consultant as well as a realtor. we did a 1-month renovation on our home and all of the costs were in line with what andre suggested. very helpful.

andre is the best. hire him."
3210,my heat stopped working. i called flores and another highly reviewed company. they both told me the same repairs need to be made. flores was less expensive. their quote to replace my whole 12 year old system was also lower than their competitor. i chose to just have the repairs done. i know the clock is ticking on my 12 year old system. jorge's communication was excellent and there were no suprises.
3211,generic montreal strip club. woman are beautiful depending on the night you go and what time. its pretty dirty and needs renovations but aside from that the dancers make it worthwhile.

3214,"simply put, i couldn't be more impressed with a plumbing company. if you have plumbing needs, and feel intimidated about not knowing what is wrong, or how much it could cost, catania and son needs to be called. jerry and evan are the next door neighbors or best friend you can call on to help. everything they did was done with sincere explanation and came with various options for repair. if you want it done right, you will call these two upstanding men, before you call anyone else!"
3215,i have used this company for several years and when my ge oven decided to quit heating i called them again. martin came out and found the igniter went bad and made the repair. quick and easy and done.
3216,"repaired leaking 2nd floor decking. were quick to arrive and provide an estimate. estimator took time to educate me on the process. workers arrived and explained their plan. they did the work, cleaned up and left without leaving a trace. the new deck looks a 1000 times better than the one our original builder did.

would gladly use ky-ko again and would recommend them."
3217,christian is awesome!!! i will definitely book him again for all my handyman needs. he responded to my quote request very fast. he showed up on time and works very fast. he assembled my 12' trampoline in a little less than an hour! he was very friendly and professional.
3218,i've had several pieces of luggage repaired and the work is always excellent.  i'd recommend this business to anyone who expects the repair done right the first time!
3219,"i would recommend dyna-tronics to a friend.  they are a little pricy but they are a small local business so i am okay with that.  they were able to repair an older demon receiver  for me that was completely broken (electronic glitches).  i had two other people look at it who said it was just ""fried"" and might as well get a new one.  the fix cost about 20% the cost of a buying new.  i am happy to keep a classic on the road for many more years now."
3220,dave was very responsive via yelp and text. prompt attention to my small job to check my irrigation system in my courtyard. the tech made some minor repairs and explained how the system works. fair price. i would definitely use them again if the need arises.
3221,it's very refreshing to met a honest ac repair company.  i have used other ac companies in the past due to free or extremely cheap ac system inspection the repairman always turn into salesman. celeb was straightforward and found part that was starting to weaken but did not pressure to replace it.
3222,"have used him for many years excellent work.
works on every type of metal or gem repair to custom new."
3223,jb set out to get a repair done with professionalism.  he offered input and different price options for completing the project.  his price was on point.  his worker showed respect to me and my husband.  they were very clean when they arrived and left.  i will call on him when ever i am in need of a handy man

3225,went to get flat repair.. chris deuel was professional amd i was out in a timely manner..
3226,"j.b. shows up on time, is thorough with his work, and knows what he's doing. he takes his time to make sure the job is done right. he is tidy, friendly, and does not charge you until the job is done. he is knowledgeable in all areas of construction, so he can do most jobs around your house himself. he will not charge you more than the estimate if it takes him longer or it is more complicated than he thought. i definitely recommend him for any of your handyman needs. he will often come on the same day or weekends if you need him. a good guy and a great handyman."
3227,"steve shinn of homework remodels has been a invaluable consultant on the slow but steady renovation of our 66 year old midcentury modern home. he helped us prioritize the work we needed done, then found reliable and skilled contractors to update our 60+-year-old roof and air conditioning systems. he was sensitive to our need to maintain a historically intact roofline and recommended a foam process that has has since made a world of difference in the weatherizing of our home. the under-eave board replacements also matched the historic character of the home. the crews arrived on time, coordinated well together and respected the surrounding property throughout the hot and messy job. we're thrilled with the results.

steve is clearly passionate about energy efficiency and is a leader in his industry asthe first remodeler in phoenix to get certified as a certified green remodeler,and has since been certified bythe building performance institute as a building performance analyst. we're so glad we chose steve to help us make very important decisions that we anticipate paying off in the decades to come."
3228,"we contacted alan's air after having another company come out who quoted us 5 times to fix our ac unit.  the other company even suggested we replace our ac unit at $8k since they mentioned the repair costs would be over third of the cost for new unit.

alan was able to just replace the capacitor in under 30 min and costs me 5 less than what ac by j quoted in shorter amount of time.

thank you alan!!!"
3229,"my daughter had an issue recently with the water line to her house from the city meter (i.e. it was leaking).  greg and joe are absolutely the best!  they came out immediately, assessed the situation, waited around for the city to confirm the repair was good, and performed all tasks in a professional manner.  this company is awesome and i would highly recommend them for all your plumbing needs.  thanks joe and greg we truly appreciate your honesty, integrity and truly good work!!  until the next time!"

3234,i just had my garage door repaired by rx garage doors.  very fast and fair.  i called several companies for estimates and mike was the only one that said it might be repaired rather than replaced.  that is exactly what happened and for less than half of what a new door would cost.  call somebody that can think outside the box and save money too.
3235,"wow!  what a great company!  we used them for a fun night out for the kiddos.  we arranged for their party bus to take our litle ones to a disney concert.  the air went out on the bus and they could not have been more apologetic and accomdating.    they had a mobile repair unit out to repair the ac before the concert was over.  they called me the next day to apoligize and were unbelievable in settling our account.   i was really impressed.  i assumed i would need to call them to discuss the billing but they called first thing in the morning and were so gracious and truly sorry.  the ride home was great and the kids had a blast.  we will use them again without hesitation!
b"

3237,"zona restoration was amazing!!! i had some mold damage that was showing in our bathroom so i decided to look into getting it fixed. i found zona restoration on a search online, and i had remembered seeing their trucks around the town so i gave them a call. the owner aaron (yeah the owner!)  came out the next day and assessed the damage and figured out the source right away. they were able to do all the demolition and repair within the week and were extremely fast and professional. having a ten month old they also, helped work around our schedule while doing a fantastic job, which was unbeleiavble helpful.

3239,"i called win. they were booked weeks out. i did not have the chance to work with them but i had a wonderful and educational conversation with the booking agent. i have to give them 5 stars here!!! i was educated on how to pick an inspector, what are the right questions to ask and, most importantly, how fast the report will be made ""digitally"" to the home buyers. this is critical as some contracts stipulate that a buyer must propose demands of what to repair in three days or forfeit their right."
3240,"mike is the best handyman that my company is working with.
he's always available, his great personality and professionalism are unique.
don't hesitate to call mike with any problem you have that related to your house.

thanks guys!"
3242,"i had a leak through one of my exhaust fans on the roof leaking through the laundry room exhaust fan.  craig came out and fixed it in one minute at no charge.  he said the roof looked fine and would be okay since we were selling in 3 weeks.  he said there were some minor issues an inspector might find but not to worry.  the first roofer that came out wanted $16,500 to do the whole roof before we sold it or $1,500 to repair the leak.  
if you want an honest and professional roofer, call craig at brown roofing.  i will recommend them to anyone looking for roof repairs or replacement."
3243,"when something breaks i am incredibly impatient and want things fixed right away! in a complete panic after waking up to a cold shower, i called flash plumbing. parker came out that day to repair my broken hot water heater. it was obvious he takes great pride in his work.  after he finished, he took the time to answer all my questions about possibly installing a tankless water heater when my current one finally goes out.  any plumbing work i need in the future will absolutely be done by parker!"

3251,"we were recently selling a property we owned and the buyers home inspector noted that the garage door was not operating exactly how it should so i put a call in to fred at garage door commander. 

after explaining to fred the inspector's concerns he explained to me exactly where i needed to do to make the adjustment. since this was at the request of the buyer i preferred to have a ""professional"" make the repair to appease our buyer.

fred was out first thing the following morning at the time he promised. within 10 minutes he had made the adjustments and gave the door and opener a quick once over. 

to top it off his invoice price was incredibly reasonable. i would not hesitate at all to recommend garage door commander to anyone."

3255,"staff is always helpful! howard has been there for a long time & has been a huge help when i'm trying to fix or repair vintage lamps & looking for hard to find pieces. huge selection, great sales! ive bought so much lighting from here, ive lost track. you also can buy the stuff to make your own lamp if your want to be creative. they have a big selection of other home decor besides lamps. i have a bling bling fetish so i'll always be walking in there door time & time again!! meant to update review last night but never to late. oh yes & always try to remember about there sales. you can ask the staff if they know when the next one is coming around (if its not near a holiday weekend, like this weekend). they usually know & the savings can be huge!"

3257,"when it comes to selling your home, courtesy and attentiveness are paramount in a real estate agent, and the hill group is second to none! prior to selling our home, my wife and i had been renting it out for two years to a very difficult tenant. the hill group, led especially by our agent doug hill, was fantastic in working with that tenant to show the house while it was still being lived in, coordinating schedules with contractors to help with repairs (once the tenant moved out), and helping us to get the house ready for sale, down to every last detail with outstanding attentiveness. i was amazed at how well each member - joshua, bill, derek, kirsten, and especially doug - worked together, going above and beyond to help us sell our home. this is our 8th time either selling or buying a home, and hands-down doug has been the most organized, on-top-of-his-game realtor that we have worked with!  great work and thanks again!"

3265,"highly recommend

this is the second year we have had them do our ""annual tune-up"" for our a/c.  in spite of the fact that we have a home warranty who we would call for any repairs, both technicians  -- who obviously know their business well (this year it was jeremy -- i don't remember the name of the guy last year...) went out of their way and took the time to explain all issues and answer all questions. if we are ever in a position that our home warranty does not cover repair or replacement of our unit, i will not hesitate to call sierra..."

3267,"don't even read on.  stop looking and go here for anything from major repairs to a simple set up. i came to alan because of the high rating and there is a reason for those 5 stars. 
my fender starcaster had the worst nut job imaginable. chipped paint, a nut that wasn't set right glued on with gorilla glue and ridiculously high action. alan has the before and after pictures. 
everything was explained step by step with price quotes. there was no rush on it but it was still done in a week. the finished product left me speechless as i thought it was not salvageable to begin with. the set up made the guitar play like a dream.  only person in this town to trust with any guitar."
3268,"williams irrigation came out next day to repair my leaking drip that was originating from under my pavers. they fixed the leak, installed a conduit (that my paver contractor should have done) so i can easily pull the flexible pipe from under pavers in the event i have issues in the future. fair price. they cleaned up the dirt and gravel nicely. great job!"
3269,"what an amazing experience we had with this design team! it couldn't have been easier. after our consultation they put together the cutest theme called arizona basement blitz complete with design, elevations, and a list of products to make the room perfect. it was a contemporary south western themed basement with football touches threaded throughout. from there they ordered everything and coordinated shipments, coordinated with a handyman to put it together as well as a contractor to build our bar. we hosted poker night when the setup was complete and everyone was amazed! it look fantastic and they couldn't have been easier to work with. we highly recommend this design team! will definitely use them on future projects. thank you! :)"

3274,"sin city is always a crazy good time and drais is no different. i come here around 3am after leaving xs, light, hakkasan. i'm a guy so i understand i gotta pay to play. don't mind paying the cover charge as long as i know i'm gonna have fun. it is at bally's instead of the old bill's casino since the building is going under renovation. i heard the new one will be opening soon. i prefer the edm room over the hip hop one but it really is just preference. chick to dude ratio is pretty even. a must on your bucket list if you have never done an after hours. i recently brought some friends here and they agreed it was unlike anything else from california."
3275,"i had charlie do a a few jobs around the house, great rates and very professional. i'd be happy to recommend him to anyone who's looking for handyman work."

3280,had a leak in the bathtub drain. manny came out on time and quickly replaced the pop-up drain in the bathtub that i had replaced incorrectly. he showed me what i did wrong and i got a plumbing lesson as well as having the problem fixed. i would highly recommend twin home experts (especially manny) for plumbing repairs.
3281,"i called this company after we noticed some leaks after a big storm.  the owner, craig brown,  diagnosed the problem (a crack in the a/c unit) and repaired it at no charge.
before even looking at it, he advised me to call at least 3 companies for estimates, so he obviously has no fear of competition.  he arrived early, was friendly, helpful, and professional, and i will definitely be calling this company in the future for any roofing issues.

3283,"this afternoon we found some unsettling water damage that led us to call yes plumbing ! this is our first experience with this company and i am honestly more than satisfied! we were quoted a time of 8:30 pm but were excited to hear they could come out sooner for our estimate ! spencer came to our house and was more than professional, he entered our house with booties and was a friendly face ! after quoting us the price to cut the wall and find the source of the leak he made 2 clean holes. he quickly found the leak and went right to work ! after the work was done he helped advise us on how to get the drywall repaired professionally! he was so knowledgeable  and professional at such a young age and it was a pleasure meeting him . we will definitely be using this company for any additional repairs we may (but hopefully don't...) need !"

3286,"one 114 degree day,  i found my front grass flooded from a bad leak.  i had to shut the water off from the city for the leak to stop. i couldn't water the landscaping and had no water to my home.  it was not fun.  it was friday afternoon and many places either didn't work weekends or were totally booked for days ahead.  i called magaard irrigation and spoke to alicia who was so pleasant and understanding.  they too were booked for days ahead but she said she would see what she could do.  daniel came out the same day and analyzed the situation.  the water was from the city (a 24/7 leak) and was leaking on my side of the property line.  daniel and jimmy performed the necessary repairs and replaced my grass so that you were not aware it had been dug up.  they were both extremely proficient, skilled and very pleasant.  i was so grateful for their immediate attention to my emergency.  i highly recommend magaard irrigation."

his field of repair and competers...100%"

3289,"this is the 3rd time we have used this awesome company, as long as they are in business i'll never call anyone else for glass repairs or replacement. they understand how important the customer experience is, they have yet to disappoint, and i doubt they ever will.

i called on monday afternoon at 2pm, they were in my driveway at 9:30am the next morning and done within an hour. simply the best, no other way to say it."
3290,"not only did mike show up and do all the necessary repairs in a timely fashion, but his estimate was less than half of what the previous company gave us.  we'll be calling him again with any ac needs."
3291,"i called arthur at 7am when both upstairs and downstairs air conditioners stopped blowing cold air.  he had both units repaired by 9am.  i was not asking him to come out quickly. i think he just knew yesterday was 114 degrees, and wanted to fix it immediately. he was professional, courteous, fair, and knowledgeable.  when i mentioned to him that his yelp reviews were all 5 stars, he said he values quality over quantity.  i would call on him again."
3292,"dean came out to give me an estimate on my tile and flat roofs last year.  i had already got 2 quotes before his.  i had dean come out a year later after we sprung a leak in the bedroom this year!  he asked me some questions about my additional leaks on my flat roofs at my scuppers and proceeded to go up top and do a long inspection. i was supplied a new quote hard paper within 24 hours.  i like what we spoke about and what was on the quote and the extra's they included in the job the others just never spoke about.  yes this was a big job 15k.

wow, dean what a great guy not only did he want to reassure me this job would be taken on as if it was his house own roof!  he went over in high detail his quote for both the flat and tile roofs and all the materials used in doing the whole new roof and the time line of job when how long what to expect and what was next in each step in the process !  i was blown away by how honest he was and not trying sell me something i did not need!  30 days later work got started!  1st day tear off, 2nd day tear off and delivery of roof products on rwp crane truck on the roof, 3rd day new underlayments, tile batons, wood  repairs on fascia boards while at least 5-6 guys working from 7am till 3pm everyday....actually one day they had 8 here, counting dean the general manager and even craig brown owner on 3 days also involved in the job at the job site!

these guys picked up every day, brought in the truck to load all used material to haul away each day.  brought in all their own equipment, handle all the wood replacements throughout the roof as needed.  they did all the final cleanup, perfectly, they did the painting on all new metal, new wood and flashings that no other companies would have done! they also did an acrylic coating on my patio roof over and above the contract as a favor to me. these guys rocked the roof and worked with me very well and i'm very particular in my needs.
5 stars!!!!!

so when you do need a roof you should be calling them to do the work for sure  at brown roofing."
3293,these guys are great. free estimates and timely repairs at competitive prices. very good at what they do

3295,"blake is awesome!!!
i've had plumber nightmares in the past.  im always looking for a bargain...a deal!  today i looked for quality because of my past experiences.  i thought i might as well go with a branded well known and bite the bullet 

he came.  he repaired. and he was less than the discounters. soooo knowledgeable.   instantly knew what was wrong and fixed it quickly.  

yay!!! i have a new plumber.  thank you larkin and blake"
3296,"i needed a new roof after the hail storm of 2010 and a coworker referred  brown roofing so i had craig come give me an estimate..he was my third estimate and his estimate came in under the other 2 with more options(adding ridge vents and extra venting).  

i decided to go with his company and i couldn't have been more satisfied.  they did a beautiful job and did it very fast. they changed lots of rotten wood and fascia boards and everything was cleaned up after each day. it was a total stress free experience. 

after 3 years since the new roof.. i have had zero problems and i love the way it looks on my home. i've referred brown roofing to anyone i know that mentioned they needed a roof. if you need a roof or any repairs don't hesitate to give him a call."

3305,"greg was great to work with. he explained his inspection findings with easy-to-understand language and pictures, and was happy to answer any questions along the way. he published the inspection report to an online system that makes it easy to view and manage. he also called the day after the inspection to make sure we could access the report and didn't have any further questions.
i really appreciate that greg not only pointed out items for repair/maintenance, but also highlighted features of the home that made it safer and more desirable. when you're buying an older house it's nice to know the good along with the bad.
i would absolutely recommend greg to anyone looking for a good inspector."
3306,"i am always skeptical when a companies reviews are so overwhelmingly outstanding, but in spite of that i gave them a shot. i am glad i did. 

kenny responded within a few minutes after i sent in a repair request through their website. the unit was starting up and shutting down every minute or so. i assumed a major repair like a compressor or worse yet, a new unit. i was pleasantly surprised when kenny told me it was the overflow sensor for the drain. he told me i probably needed a new one so i told him to go ahead and change it out. when he was finished i was even more surprised when he told me that the sensor wasn't bad, it was just that the drain was plugged  causing the sensor to trip on and off.  

kenny could have gone ahead and changed out the sensor and charged me for it, i wouldn't have known the difference, but he didn't. i appreciate his honesty as well as him saving me a few bucks. maybe that is why the company is called honest air conditioning."
3307,"brown roofing did a fantastic job on our roof. we had the underlayment replaced, the facia repaired and the patio roof repaired. it was repaired on time, on budget and best of all, it was high quality work.

craig brown was great to work with. he explained everything that they were going to do in way that was easy to understand. he & his crew did everything that they said they were going to do, which is exactly what you want in a contractor. i would highly recommend brown roofing to anyone who needed roof repairs."

3315,"i couldn't be happier with my selection of noble painting.  i thought the price was fair but the attention to detail was extraordinary.  kenny, the owner, met with me personally before the job and described what the process would be and the timing and he totally delivered on his promises.  the work was done perfectly and our house has never looked so good.  because we had a poor paint job done years ago, noble not only did their job but they repaired the bad work of previous painters.

i 100% recommend this company to anyone looking for a high quality paint job at a reasonable price executed with honesty and professionalism."
3316,"david responded almost immediately to a question, even though it was after hours. he arranged a next day visit and arrived early. he gave multiple options to repair my opener. when troubleshooting showed it needed replacing, he had the new one up and running in a very short time. very friendly, professional and eager to answer questions. recommend!"

3324,we had a handful of home renovations and az build pro delivered. we love everything they did. they are very professional. i've got children and always feel weird about being home with strangers working in our home. i felt incredibly comfortable with everyone who came to our house. the workmanship was exceptional and we are so happy with the end result.
3325,"i contacted julio in the afternoon about some drywall repair work that needed to be done after fixing a water leak in our ceiling.  the next day, one of his guys was at the house at 7am and got the job done in just a few hours.  we couldn't be happier with the response, quality of work and professionalism.  we highly recommend 702 painting & drywall!"
3326,"after my wife put a massive hole in the bedroom wall, i made an attempt at the repair myself. my attempt was a mess so i decided to call julio with summit painting/drywall. julio arrived whilst i was at work and got the job done within only a couple of hours. 
i always appreciate when a contractor is courteous & reliable. julio & frank were extraordinarily professional and the final outcome was perfect!

they were able to match the texture exactly to a point of where the hole will never be seen again. i highly recommend summit painting & drywall."
3327,"competitive and competent work.  they missed on the estimate by $200 because they left a part out, which we only learned about after we had begun the repair."
3328,i have used t&k multiple times now.  i chose them originally from the positive reviews on yelp and they did not disappoint.  the first time was a small repair and tommy diagnosed the issue and corrected the problem at a very reasonable rate.  the 2nd time was a major repair and tommy and pedro worked a 10 hour day to ensure the job was done correctly before they left for the day.  i would not hesitate to use them again for any electrical projects i would have in the future.
3329,"the best home inspector i met. very detailed orientated and being he's inspected over 300 homes in shea trilogy, vistancia, he's your go to guy. did a 3-1/2 hour inspection and received a printout before leaving. later that evening i received the summary and full report in my email. 

what makes ron special is he inspects areas like roof and attic that shea won't and he works for us and our best interests not the developer. 

nothing but praise for ron dye. 

lastly, shea accepted all ron's suggested repairs and will be completed in two weeks. 

thanks, ron"

3332,"abel was very communicative and completed the jobs we asked him.  he removed two unused satellite dishes from my house, installed exterior window shutters on the second floor of our house, and repaired damaged stucco.  he helped me avert possible fines from my neighborhoods' hoa."
3333,"we've used sears repair 3 times now to fix various issues with washer and dryer.  each time the tech has been very polite, knowledgeable, and competent!  always know when they are on the way, and always arrive on time.  they are my go to for all things home repair!"

3335,"i needed to have my roof repaired. i received a number of bids from some companies and decided to get one from diamond roofing/steve mullins. steve reviewed my problem areas (3) explaining what wood structure needed to be replaced due to dry rot and other damage. he also explained how the other areas of the roof such as the ""valleys"" would be brought up to code using the newer channels. i mentioned that the roofer who put in the original roof skimped on tiles and these were brought up to snuff. steve had a crew of three work on the roof for 8.5 days. the crew was respectful, and went about their work in a methodical manner, as the job progressed. i was impressed with how they went about their work. diamond also replaced the rolled asphalt roofing on my rear deck and the attached sofia and facia. they replaced all the bird stop and added drip stop on the roof edges where none had been before. pricing of the job was competitive with other companies, with the exception the other guys charge extra for any wood which has to be replaced. steve included the wood in his bid. i only provided the paint. when it came time to pay the pauper, the bill was exactly as specified.

i'd have no hesitation in using diamond roofing again or recommend friends to them."
3336,"i am very satisfied with the work and keeping me informed of when they 
were going to my dad's former condo to do repairs after a water leak.
the place looked better than it ever did when they were finished."
3337,i have referred this company to a few of our clients that have solar.  they do both roof repair and solar which is what our clients needed.  they have been professional and done great work.
3338,"well, thanks to king david, my dryer sucks! no, literally. 

because the air duct was smashed between our dyer and wall, it was not allowing the air to suck air through the dryer unit and exit the outdoor vent. could i have done the repair? probably. would my wife have wanted me to do the repair? probably not. 

so, it was worth it to have an expert come out to do the repairs!! give em' a call! he'll hook you up!"
3339,"wait what the heck?! :""""""""(  i loved it here so much, their london fog was the beeeessst, and the last time i came here it said closed for renovation,  but now i was dying to go today, just to find out they're closed permanently? :'(

it's far from me or i would've been there all the time lolol but i'm sad they're gone :("
3340,"billy has made several repairs to a few of my guitars, electric and acoustic.  his work is always top notch, and i have never had a problem whatsoever, with his workmanship.  i think he is honest and trustworthy, and like to refer him to friends whenever i can."
3341,"i recently had my countertops replaced and not only was joe nice, very prompt, the counters were installed as scheduled, and he was very knowledgeable on other things i need done in the home. he gave me very good suggestions and even a flyer for a handyman for other things i need done. my kitchen looks like a brand new kitchen and i will definitely be using joe for the other granite installations that i need."
3342,"unbelievalby honest!!  i had 4 other companies out and craig brown was the only one who spent more time explaing why he recommends not doing any repairs on my roof than trying to sell me on the job.  if you want an honest and ethical roofer, call brown."
3343,it's very hard to find reliable people for what many may refer to as a small job. finally i found a company that does a great job for large and small jobs around the house. i would highly recommend ruben and b4 and after home repair for home projects or repairs.
3344,"outstanding, dedication, professionalism, decisive and a can-do attitude for everything that he was challenged to do. thank you so much for all your help correcting a 1922 sq ft pergo nightmare that was started by someone else, to a pergo outstanding beautiful quality job and perfected the previous floor job!! should've called nw handyman solutions first for floor job. thank you bryan and david, great team!"
3345,contacted me within hours of my request for a quote. came by to give me an estimate before anyone else even responded and scheduled and completed the repairs on my schedule. easy to work with and arrived on time and did the work as promised. all in all a great experience with a professional and reliable company. i'll use them again.
3346,"very satisfied!!  i needed a huge interior wall repaired and with a special texture, in addition to exterior stucco repairs.  great communication, job was done quickly and extremely well done."
3347,"jeff came to do the initial inspection himself, and actually climbed on my roof, removed debris to get to the tiles, then pulled up tiles for an accurate assessment of my roof and underlayment. he inspected multiple areas on my roof, not just where i suspected a problem. he came down off the roof and assured me that he could help, and explained  the repair process. i appreciate the truth up front! so long story made short, roofstar came out, fixed my roof ahead for schedule and at a lower cost than the 2 other company's had quoted and gave me a guarantee. i will and have recommend jeff and roofstar to everyone who has a roofing need."
3348,chris and team were awesome. they came out and gave me a bid and we scheduled the work to be done. they showed up on time and did excellent work. they relocated sprinkler lines and repaired many valves on my system. they did excellent work and the price was fair. i have recently relocated to vegas from nd and have found out that many of the so called professionals that you call to have work done are simply nothing more than scam artists and their only way they seem to know how to do business is to overcharge for the work and then do a poor job after showing up hours or sometimes even days late. rocca's is the exception to this rule. they are professional and show up on time and do excellent work and don't overcharge you. my experience was as good as it gets. well done chris and team. highly recommended.
3349,"ky-ko roofing along with representative mark lian saved me over $2500.

i had a quote from another roofing company. they said i needed to remove a large portion of my roof tiles and repair soffits.

mark looked at the roof and said it was only cosmetic, something our painter could repair while painting the house.

thank you ky-ko for being honest and saving me money."
3350,"i requested 3 quotes and vegas born was the third that came out. i had a couple leaks in my roof due to heavy rains this year. after the first one tried to up sell me to remove part of my to and another saying everything was fine and wanted $500 dollars for a roof certification, vegas born did exactly what was needed. they pin pointed the leaks and made sound repairs without any invasive maintenance. this was goo because one leak was close to solar panels.. all the leaks had to with flashing, sealant, or covers on vents.. they were quick and professional. i highly recommend them, they will be thorough and fair in pricing! the job will be done right!"
3351,"great selection of condiments for a hotdog!!! not sure if this is standard for a sonoran hot dog spot... nacho cheese, chorizo, cheddar ruffles remnants, guacamole, parmesan, mushrooms, all the good stuff and more! we ordered the el chile (the regular with chile) and the el regular. loaded them up and enjoyed. heads up, the parking was a little awkward. it shares the lot with a gas station that closed for renovations."
3352,"i just recently had my roof repaired and re-coated.  from start to finish, brown did a top notch job.  their proposal was competitive and submitted in a timely manner, the communication and scheduling was clear and well organized, and the execution of the job was flawless.  all of the employees that i talked with were courteous and professional.  as a follow-up to the roof work, i had my home inspection partner inspect the work.  his comments were that brown did an excellent job!  i highly recommend them."
3353,"after some strong rain storms, we found a leak in one of the bedrooms. after getting numerous quotes from contractors we opted to do business with craig at brown roofing. craig was very knowledgeable and took the time to inspect the roof and then draw out how the placement of the new material will look an a sheet of paper. his quote was fair and in most cases better than his competitors as he installs 2 layers of underlayment vs 1 from others. debbie penciled us in about 7 weeks out due to it being a busy season. once craig and his team showed up, all work was completed in less than 4 days. they were very professional and left us satisfied with the choice we made. the roof looks great and now we are set for at least 15 years. as a local real estate agent, i will most certainly recommend brown roofing to any of my clients in need of roof repair."
3354,"ok, this place is awesome! i called them for a 2nd opinion because the other company i called said that we needed a new unity. bill came over right away and fixed the problem right away. the motor was bad and found out that the other company had lied to me about what needs repair! i'm so thankful for them! they are honest and i would highly recommend them!"
3355,"every business has its good and bad days but i have used this guy for years. both total re-plumbing from galvanized pipe to copper supply and plastic waste, remodel and general maintenance. i blew up a pressure reducer valve. i shut the main off and terry himself the owner showed up with another one within 2 hours and replaced it. free. it had to be 20 years old. it just blew apart for no reason. was fair on my repairs over the years, also on my heating and cooling. recommended him to friends and family.
that was my only real small emergency and he showed right up."
3356,"i contacted envy for what i thought would be too small of a project for them. we needed two outdoor decorative lighting fixtures installed and electrical ran to them. 

jordan came out and gave us a scope of the work involved and even made a few smart suggestions. 

he was even able to squeeze us in before a new years party we were having. (last minute work on our end)

once the work was started, we were updated on every single aspect of the job. they were all very friendly and even put up with our great dane running around. 

jordan and his team went above and beyond for us. 

we will now be reaching out to them for other home renovations for the year."
3357,rocca repair came a assess my problem. chris and co-worker were very friendly and spent at least 15 minutes but determined that my problem was not an irrigation problem. they did not charge me for their time. very professional. thank you.
3358,i just want to say vonda has been very helpful with all my needs in renting one of there properties and getting repairs done and information to me when i need it
3359,"i've used deek's twice. last year steve came out and fixed our heater and this year he fixed the ac. when it's 112 degrees outside all the ac companies in town are blowing up with repair calls, but deek's was able to come out within 24 hours. i called two other companies and one was a three day response and the other was two days. steve told me the problem was just a faulty switch and it only cost $5.00 to replace it. he could have easily told me it was a bad circuit board or a bad compressor and charged me a ton more, but he was honest. when choosing an ac repair company that's all you want, somebody you can trust."
3360,awesome company.  called on a friday to have my bumper fixed and repainted and by monday at 3:30 is was not only complete it was flawless.  would highly recommend this company if you need a paint repair done with a mobile company.
3361,"i messaged the company at 10:15pm and felt really bad doing that so late. justin (one of the owners) replied within 5 mins and gave me a possible issue and quote to my problematic water heater. we confirmed an appointment for the following day. charlie (one of the other owners) came by at the appointment time and within 30 mins diagnosed, confirmed the problem and repaired the problem. i would highly recommend this company to friends and family in the future."
3362,"doug did some door & window repairs on my rental unit in vegas. he was very responsive, professional & cost effective. my tenant can be difficult to get a hold of, but doug coordinated the job & completed the work without any involvement from me. my tenant was left with a huge grin with his new door. i will definitely call doug again if my rental units need repairs."
3363,"kelly and andrew are awesome! they do excellent work, are knowledgeable and very friendly. if you have ground up construction, remodel work or a small repair job they can handle it. i highly recommend them."
3364,"over the last 3 years i have had the greatest experiences with 4 a/c.  bob and debra have never been less than kind professional and honest. but i frankly, i didn't hire them for their personalities. i hired them for an aging failing ac unit. each visit resulted in a well checked and repaired unit. the cost of repairs have always been fair. never was i told i needed something done that wasn't necessary.  infact, i was positive i needed a new unit this year. the unit came on when it wanted went off when it wanted with no regard to thermostat readings. not to mention there were times the unit never came on at all. i called 4 a/c for an estimate on a new unit. of course, i got 3 other estimates. not only was the unit just fine,  and all i needed was 2 aa batteries for the thermostat we also discussed the cost of a new unit should i  need one in the future. you got it, his quote was $1,300 cheaper. bob is not just efficient. he is an honest respectable person."
3365,"i have seen the jeff civillico comedy in action show twice and loved it both times.  jeff is world class juggler.  he'll juggle just about anything from ping pong balls to bowling balls, knives, and things that are on fire.  he also invents odd tricks that change from show to show, and he completely engages the audience.  in fact, if you sit in front, there is a good chance that you will end up on stage as part of his act.  little kids have an especially good time on stage.  the show takes place in the afternoon, so it's meant for families and people who want to skip sexually suggestive shows.  the theater is a little bit tough to find since the quad is under renovation, but it's totally worth the extra effort."
3366,"i have been using compuworld epson repair about 10 years now to repair my epson printers. 

they have done an amazing job throughout all this time, and i recently had them repair a large epson 9890 for me. the repair was done in a timely fashion and perfectly. 

i would highly recommend compuworld!"
3367,"i have worked with brett on numerous occasions both professionally as a realtor and personally. he is always extremely prompt, professional, and knowledgeable. i will continue to use him for hvac repairs for my home, my rental properties, and will not hesitate to refer him to my clients buyer or selling a home."
3368,i've been here countless times for home repairs and diy projects. staff is always friendly and items are always in stock. my only complaint is that it seems lowe's has higher quality lumber and lowe's appears to organize their lumber section better. other than that. love home depot!
3369,"albert is so very reliable, honest and efficient! i completely trust him when it comes to my repairs. there is no one out there like him! he is truly great!"
3370,"i called them at 0800 on a saturday morning in june (high for the day was 108 degrees) and darren was there in under 3 hours.  they were not able to give me a time frame, because he was going to stop by after he completed his previously scheduled appointments.  however, they did call about 30 min before he arrived to let me know he was on the way.   

the repair only took about 10 min.  he did not try to up-sell me on anything or do any unnecessary maintenance, he simply made the repair that needed so that my ac worked - which turned out to be a $30 part.  darren was professional and efficient. as a female, i feel like a a lot of repairmen will attempt to take advantage of my perceived ""ignorance"", but not darren.   i felt completely comfortable with him making repairs and not attempting to rip me off. there was no indication he even considered taking advantage of my lack of knowledge - which is an amazing feeling! 

highly recommend this company!  i wish i could give it more 5 stars!"
3371,"there are very few companies i have dealt with in my life that will stand behind their word. although there was miscommunication initially, perfection handyman came by and fulfilled their contract with me. they could not fix the problem only because of a faulty item which was not their fault. however, they came by and did their best and explained the situation. they were very professional,  courteous and clearly have many people who have had good work done by them. thus i am retracting my harsh criticism of them since all has been resolved to my satisfaction."
3372,"i love this place.   fast, reliable. doesn't try to upsell me unnecessary repairs.  thanks for your help!"
3373,ivan was our tec.he was very good at making repair to our washer.this company is a small business but very effeciant. we will use them again..they were also right on time...
3374,dave is simply wonderful. he will make sure that you are well informed and he will keep the costs of repairs affordable. you will be in good hands.
3375,"alex responded to my request for a quote in less than 4 hours.  made an appointment to repair the coach lights in front of my garage.  he arrived on time, found the problem and fixed it within the time frame he estimated.  problem solved and fees very reasonable."
3376,"saneyee is amazing! first..she is such a kind and calming, wonderful person! second- what she does is unique and fantastic.  she comes to you! making having acupuncture so convenient. she arrives perfectly on time, with her table and all of her supplies. extremely professional. extremely. then after your initial consultation she combines acupuncture with acupressure, craniosacral , aroma therapy, and other wonderful techniques to provide the ultimate in rest, rejuvenation, and repair. i cannot recommend her highly enough.  call her.. just don't take my appointment time!"
3377,they winterized my sprinkler system for years and they were always very punctual.  i've also asked for assistance with repairs over the years and they've always been quick with responses and help.
3378,"we would like to thank doug's bugs and bunnies for their hard labor.  they are very nice and done a great job at helping us maintain our vw panel bus.  we have even brought our volvo for repairs and they have been gracious enough to get it fixed, and fixed right.  they are willing to wok with you, and go above and beyond our expectations.  fish and gilbert are courteous an professional.  thank you doug's bugs and bunnies!"
3379,"we've dealt with paula from tradewinds and she always responds promptly. the microwave and dryer didn't work when we moved in and she contacted the owners and we got new ones within a week. the stove didn't work and the repair guy was there the next available day. would rent from them again if everyone was as easy to deal with as paula, thanks!"
3380,"matt at stellar has done multiple repairs for me over the years, for both myself and my clients. standout contractors are hard to come by when it's busy. matt always delivers. he's personable, professional and always gets the job done when promised."
3381,"i called scottsdale plumbing based on a recommendation from our handyman. robert was prompt, courteous and competently replaced our water main in the timeframe promised in his estimate."
3382,"wow! this location is doing some major renovations. and i like it a lot. it has an upscale mood to it. everything is very well laid out with a modern and clean look. i can't wait till they finish with the renovations. plus this location is right off the highway, very convenient."
3383,"love this place. but it's been closed for a month. a sign in the window says ""under renovation"" but there is no indication if or when it will reopen. disappointing."
3384,"decided to call citywide based on positive online reviews. we suspected a slab leak and a really expensive repair. robert showed up within 20 minutes, determined the source of the leak within 5 minutes, and it turned out to be something really simple and inexpensive. he repaired it with a brand new line, we paid, and he left within a half hour of us calling citywide. very professional, friendly, and efficient! would definitely recommend citywide for anyone's plumbing needs."
3385,contacted chris and within an hour he was at our house. he diagnosed our ceiling leak - which turned out to be an issue with our ac. he called someone out to deal with the demolition and repair and they showed up within an hour as well. very satisfied with chris's professionalism.
3386,conrads has contacted me to try and resolve the repair...i appreciate that they reached out to me and that they are trying to assist.
3387,"we had a list of things that needed to be done to a rental house and the work was great and the workers were nice and professional. 
the price was comparable to other quotes we had, but dough was fair in re-negotiating  certain quoted prices because of miscommunication or unnecessary parts purchased. 
will definitely call for any future repairs."
3388,perfection!  had some minor damage repaired and they did a great job!  looks great and was ready earlier than expected.  everyone was very professional
3389,"cell repair took 3 days, not his fault, he just didn't have the parts in stock.  completed repair under budget."
3390,"its crazy how close this park is to everything. 
sony centre for performing arts...
gooderham building... 
st. lawrence market...
even union station is a quick walk to this park. 
this park underwent a massive renovation which shows in not only the tiling on the floor, but is land marked by a huge fountain with a bunch of dogs all over the fountain(and a couple cats if you can find them) 
this is a great location to come and take a break from everything, but the disappointing part is that in the summertime, good luck finding a spot to have a break."
3391,"we had a gas leak.  trevor came out first thing in the morning and made the repairs.   he was very neat and pleasant.  he finished the job, they got the permits and called for the inspection in a very timely manner.  would definitely use them again."
3392,chris was wonderful and fixed my leak no problem!  ill definitely use them again if i need more repairs!
3393,"2nd visit but too much time between visits.  cozy place and very busy today. had hydrologic pale ale.  wonderful.  spouse had wrenovation, which he really enjoyed.  a patio would be the bomb."
3394,i called and spoke with mark a couple of weeks ago to ask if he would provide me with an estimate for drywall repair on a short sale home i have listed for sale. there is never a guarantee that the buyer of the home will actually select this company to do the repairs but mark was very pleasant and professional.  he checked the damaged drywall areas and provided me with a written estimate i could send to the lending institution which was very helpful. i won't forget this company when i either need drywall repairs or need to refer one of my clients to them!
3395,"after reading the reviews on the 5 star rated dekes i gave them a call on october 23rd.  i was surprised and thankful they were able to come out on the same day!  steve gave me a time frame - called me 30 minutes prior to showing up.  he is very nice and respectful i felt he was honest about my heater repair, i don't feel like he was trying to rip me off, which i am very thankful for!

my condo is upstairs, i felt bad that he had to keep going up and down to the roof - he did not complain, he did not seem irritated -he simply said this is my job and i will fix your problem!!!

i will refer dekes -100% 

thanks again steve!"
3396,"the company responded immediately to my request for an estimate to possibly repair an inoperable fountain in a home we recently purchased.   bob was on time, professional and super helpful with his suggestions on what options were available to pursue.  highly recommend this company!"
3397,"i called phend plumbing after having one of their local competitors out to assess a leak in my supply line. the first company came out at the direction of ahs home warranty, after explaining that the leak wasn't covered (which was legit) they estimated the repair to cost between $700-$900. after i spoke with their tech, i got the feeling that they were trying to capitalize on my denied claim. i immediately got on yelp, checked out reviews on the 'other guys' and immediately confirmed my suspicions. 

this is where phend comes in... after reading several of their 5-star reviews on yelp i called, spoke with their assistant and within 24 hours the repair tech clint showed up and repaired the leak within an hour! to say the least, the scope of work and total cost were considerably less than the 'other guys' quotes!

i would recommend clint and phend plumbing without hesitation!"
3398,air squad was contacted by home shield to repair our a/c due to a noisy fan. josh came out checked the unit and agreed with my concern. the part was ordered and installed in two days. my reason for the four stars is that i had to call them to confirm my appointment for the repairs.
3399,"chuck is a honest and no nonsense installer and repair person. he was very reasonable, had a great personality and delivered on everything he promised. i would not only recommend him and his company to anyone, i will be making further purchases in the future with him.  doesn't get any easier or better this company and the man behind it."
3400,"brian is the very best!! he was the most helpful and really tried to make this the best repair job....he is amazing, thank you firestone for employing such a great person."
3401,egor was on it! he didn't give up when my problem wasn't easily solved and did all repairs with knowledge and a smile... even in this hot weather! thank you!!
3402,"we have relied on vacuum check for anything vacuum-related for years! max, the owner, is always there, always pleasant, and always knowledgable. we have recommended this place to a number of people who have also had a good experience. we've purchased a new vacuum, had our house vac repaired, and purchased a number of accessories for both. we're lucky to have max and his business in our neighbourhood."
3403,tim was fast and exteremly friendly!!! my airconditioner was beyond repair and he didn't charge me for the visit at 11:30 pm!!!!!
3404,"great experience from the sales rep, kris, who explained all my options to repair, and jeremy, who explained my system, fixed the problem, and made recommendations for future low cost maintenance.
not only were they both totally knowledgeable, the timeframe for the sales visit and repair or replace was very fast.
well done gentlemen.
eric o."
3405,"okay, i'm sold. the recently completed renovation of this theater is awesome. i love the theater, i love the seats, i love that you pre-assign a seat. no longer do i have to get to the theater an hour early to get a favorite seat. my new favorite place to see a movie."
3406,he was honest and referred me to someone who could do a heater repair better and faster.  have to give 5 stars for honesty.
3407,just challenged antonella with a very difficult repair job that included self styled bangs. she did an amazing job! salon is beautiful--only a little expensive--but worth it in the long run.
3408,"so this was a repair that i did not want to have to make...but we live in a world where people feel the need to take what is not theirs. yes, my window got busted and the thieves got away. the online quote was very easy to get, the appointment scheduling was  also very easy.  the wait time was as promised. keep up the good work!"
3409,they just left. i thought i could have a big problem but they went through my system explaining everything they were doing as they went. fixed the issue in 10 minutes. made some suggestions explaining perfectly why at some time they would be a idea for convenience sake. these guys can come to my house anytime. btw if it had been what i thought it was he said repairs start at $10k.
3410,very professional outfit- website made it easy to schedule the repair- mobile unit was on time & very accommodating !! highly recommend.
3411,great repair. looks brand new with a lifetime warranty. and they took just as long as they said they would.
3412,"i have dealt with award and jeff at magnum a precision and always found them to be great gunsmiths and above all honest. the sign on the counter reads ""4-6 weeks for repairs"" that's because they're conscientious and good at what they do. why would anyone want shoddy, rushed work on a firearm?"
3413,"indispensable poutine and burger joint in saint-henri. it seems they are recently closed for renovation but the place goes as authentic as it gets, not to mention it is affordable."
3414,"after 2 unsuccessful attempts at fixing my klh 24 record player at jerry's, i found atlas' website. they seemed like true audiophiles, and they are!

my turntable was treated to top-to-bottom maintenance by their repairmen, and now is as good as new. all warble, pitch problems, sticky levers and noisy pots are a thing of the past.

thanks for making my week, atlas!"
3415,the men's restroom has been repaired
3416,the burgers here are really good. everything is made to order and comes to the table hot and fresh. they did some renovations to this location and that may explain their prices. the reason i didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the price. if you buy two combo meals the price will run you close to $30.
3417,"i had no heat coming from my 4 year old unit.. called these guys at midnight & they answered & said they'd have someone out the next day at the time i needed them to come over. 
the repairmen checked my system & tested it for 40 mins, got it throwing heat stronger than it did before & said if it happens again it could be one of two things. 
and they didn't even charge me! 
these guys are the best & i would recommend them."
3418,"i'm so happy we found a honest company 

rom came out and repaired our washer on the same day i called he also checked out dryer and removed the lint that had built up and vacuumed up after he was completed 


thank you"
3419,"moved into my rental, stove hood was out. ha contacted me through the home warranty - i am leery of most repairs vendors through old republic. they turned out to be very easy to work with - efficient, courteous and professional. from the appointment setter to the repair tech everything went very smooth. he even cleaned up after his repair - can be rare these days. 

definitely recommend."
3420,"this is a great starbucks especially after the renovations, employees are extremely polite it is actually inside of a safeway and it's well-kept. i like the seating arrangements it's one of the better starbucks in the area and i do strongly recommend that you check them out"
3421,"in my experience of 4 years having sharif and 88 realty manage my rental house, i have had only positive experiences.  this company is professional, capable and responsive to tenant and property owner requests.  when a tenant requests a repair, sharif communicates this to me and i approve the repair.  simple and direct.  i have never had any problem working with 88 realty's staff.  i strongly recommend this company.

sincerely,
nathan o'hara"
3422,"we recently purchased a new water heater from lowe's and this company installed it.   they arrived half an hour earlier than estimated and was done in about an hour!  they have installed other items in our house via lowe's a few years prior.   we hired them directly to repair/replace plumbing for one of our showers.  they've been consistently professional,  prompt, and proficient!"
3423,"excellent describes doug's work! i had him replace a hot water heater and repair the drywall box it sat on. doug was on time, fair, professional and kept things tidy as he worked...he was also kind and personable. thanks doug for saving the day! both my husband and i are grateful."
3424,i always come to this theater. it's always clean and the staff is friendly and sociable.  tuesday's are only $5 all day.  the snacks are always fresh.  it's been a couple of months since i've been in here and i see they have updated theaters 1-8. cushy reclining seats .  seems like theaters 9-16 are under current renovation since that wing is blocked off.  in my opinion this is the best theater in ne ohio.
3425,"once my ahs home warranty assigned am pm plumbing, as a savvy consumer i had to jump on yelp to see how this company fared.  well, after reading the dismally poor reviews i was really worried that the visit would 
1.  waste my time.
2.  waste my deductible required.
3.  even worse - the tech bungle it so badly that it ended up being worse than it started!
well, to my complete and utter surprise - liam came promptly, was professional, evaluated the water heater accurately, repaired the problem w/ out a hitch!  one happy customer here!  i don't know about the other techs, but i'd definitely recommend liam.  glad i was lucky to get him!"
3426,"i've done a lot of real estate renovation, so this wasn't my first time having a tankless installed. it was a bit tricky in this house (built in the '70s with the original plumbing encased in the foundation for the center-of-the-house original water heater), but these guys made it work. would absolutely recommend for tankless water heater installs."
3427,great company doug came out and gave me a fair estimate. even came and did the repairs on a saturday so i did not have to take off work. even fix my front door that wasn't closing right for free. i would recommend to anyone that doesn't want to get ripped off.
3428,"robert rocks!  

i moved from dc and not easy to find art installers in the area (most are handyman disguised as art installers).  lucky to find robert.  he made sense of the hodge podge of art i have to create a story on each wall.  he is prompt, professional and fun.  i still have some art that needs to be framed and will definitely have him return to install those too.

thanks, robert!"
3429,"jason has done two jobs for us now. he repaired some drywall damage from a roof leak and then a few weeks later we asked him to paint our family room, living room and stairway. we were extremely happy with both projects! we will definitely use him again. jason was quick to get us quotes, quick to respond to emails, and very professional on the job."
3430,"fast and cheaper than apple, i would definitely come in again. it took ten minutes and there was no wait. tempered glass was 10$ extra on top of the repair"
3431,excellent work! i had a crooked cellular shade that needed repair.  it was very difficult to fix but chuck would not give up until it was exactly straight. he even corrected work done from a prior repair. his pricing was excellent. i will definitely call again when i need work done on my blinds.

3435,"i had broken the antenna connector on my 39"" visio and although i was sure it could be repaired with a little solder, i was expecting the worst. george took a look and said he could repair it the same day, no problem. good as new! i'm a fan!"
3436,"this restaurant recently had a fire, so they're closed for renovations.
this is my favourite thai place in toronto aside from khao san road (and in my opinion, even better than)."
3437,"there were several pieces that needed to be replaced in the 12 year old system in the house i recently purchased.   my repairman came with a full set of parts, and was able to get the ro and water softener running like new for a fraction of the cost of a new system."
3438,"if you are looking through review after review, not knowing which company to choose, look no further!

today will be the third time i've used almada roofing. gilbert is very professional, and has a team of skilled workers. last year when i sold my home, they fixed a leak i was unaware of (apparently pigeon droppings collected in an area up high/out of sight, causing water to divert to areas it should not go.)
next was at a rental home where i stayed briefly before buying my current home. now today, his team is here fixing a leak due a design flaw where a vent was installed too close to a draining channel, which appears to only be affected when heavy monsoons drop a lot of water at once. 

i like that each time, gilbert took pictures of the problem so he could show and explain to new what needed to be repaired, and why. what he charges for repairs is very fair, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend him."
3439,"vertex to the rescue !!!

they inspected the leaking roof.

they returned to fix it ahead of schedule. 

they returned a second time to refine their repair--all before the last big rain.

their fee was exactly as originally quoted.

and workmen cleaned up the debris without my requesting it."
3440,"the original mall on the strip! it's been here since the 80's and had a major renovation in the last 5 years. its one of the best malls i've been to anywhere in the country. if you're looking to find something unique and you've come to a mall, your not gonna find it.  where else in the usa are you going to find a giant ""flying saucer"" 200 feet in the air in front of your mall. only in las vegas."
3441,so it was 4th of july weekend and my rooftop 4 ton ac stopped blowing cold air! it was 116 that weekend in az. the very next morning al was at my house on time and fixed my ac :) he was so genuine and wonderful. perfect person i would want to come over for these types of things. very honest and hard working. cannot say enough how thrilled i was to have such a seasoned and polite repair man. this company is easy to get a hold of and tim is great too! i will use them again for my yearly ac checkups.
3442,"i am an investor who has had many properties who have suffered for summer heat. andre understands the urgency of repair. he deals directly  with me while still being kind to my tenants.
andre works with self directed irs's
there are a lot of us who have purchased properties through our self directed ira's and like to have repairs paid from the ira. andre understands and will allow the time to have the check sent from the ira.
andre is my new go to person!!"
3443,"i had a great experience with arcadia roofing!  not only are they professional and on-time, but the owner answered all of our questions and was great to work with.  i definitely recommend them to anyone needing a new roof or repairs in arcadia!"
3444,"so.... i am guilty of eating at wildflower two days in a row. it wasn't on purpose, but when i had to get a flat repaired next door, i figured why not. i had the roasted sweet potato sandwich.... it was good the first day, but it was even better the second! their potato salad was also super tasty. the portion was huge and under 10$....gotta love that!"

3447,"i called precision because we were having some problems with our water softener.  our tech, james p. showed up early on saturday which was great.  he was unable to fix the problem but was able to show us a few things about the softener. i will be using precision if we need any other repairs done in our house."

3454,"frank called 1/2 hr before he was to arrive. he was on time, friendly and very professional. he repaired several of my outlets that were old and not working. american home shield has a winning company working for them."
3455,from the time i called black mountain air to the time michael repaired the problem with my 14 years old ac unit was 1.5 hours. impressive!
3456,my kids had a blast at the frozen fiesta and i loved the renovations that have been done. parking was a breeze.
3457,excellent place to relax. they just went thru a long due renovation and upgrades. looks and feels great.
3458,"this is my favourite park in downtown toronto, the renovation in 2017 really turned it around! i come here often as a shortcut to chinatown. you can have a picnic, hang out with all the cute dogs (there's an off-leash dog area), and enjoy the beautiful plants around the park! they even have bathrooms that are super clean."
3459,jerry thomas is an awesome artist.  he is beyond professional.  i have brought my sister and son here to. if you are looking for a seriously talented artist then come see jerry.  he has had to repair other work and i love what he has created for me.

3464,"two years ago i needed a new roof. i recieved several qoutes. arcadia roofing was the best value. they removed my old roof, gave me a day to make some needed repairs in the wood, and were done in just a few days. i appreciated how they worked around my schedule. the job was neat and professional."

3467,brought in a small antique table to be repaired and refinished.  they did a great job.  the legs were loose and it had several large scratches and some discoloration.  one of feet was missing a brass claw foot.  they found one that matched to replace it.  the finish is perfect and the cost was reasonable.
3468,"awesome place for jewelry repair!!! a++++ in quality, speed of repair, and cost! the owner is also very friendly and eager to do a good job. highly highly recommend!!!"
3469,"adil is a great guy, super easy to work with and has the most valuable assets: experience and expertise. he did a pretty big job for me in lakewood. from the time we agreed to the work, he was ready to start fairly quickly. it helped that he was already registered with the city of lakewood and the building department had only great things to say about him which says a lot. he finished the job in a reasonable amount of time, kept me posted on progress (i do not live in the house), was respectful of my tenants. i will absolutely use him again for any home improvement or repair and i will refer him to my clients (i am a realtor) and friends."
3470,"excellent job !!!!!!!   tom and dave showed up on time , courteous and professional , the repair was competed efficiently and with pride. very satisfied with the workmanship and outcome of the job performed. i would highly recommend colors on the run !!!"
3471,"great show!  good for all ages.  funny, engaging, and downright hilarious.  jeff is primarily a juggler, but don't think for a moment that's all this show is about.  he uses juggling to create these crazy moments on stage, and involves the whole audience.  very talented, and a must see.  the theater is a little hard to find (due to renovation), but the search is well worth it.  my cheeks hurt from smiling and laughing so hard!"
3472,mike dillman is the absolute best appraiser ever.  he is customer focused and explains the repairs.  absolute love this place beaciuse of him.

3474,"these guys know what they are doing and act like it.  quick to respond, quick to accurately diagnose and quick to repair.  had a unit on a four plex go bad, they diagnosed, prepared two options and had it fixed the next day.  they are definitely teh go to a/c company for me."
3475,"great place. very knowledgable staff and i found my commando wire saw that i had been searching high-and-low for! good selection of footwear and climbing gear, different types of ropes and packs. again, great place. rei actually referred me to them for a tent repair.

note- after 40 years they are not on cave creek anymore. they moved down to thomas."
3476,"vertex roofing rescued my fabulous steel roof a second time.  a giant palm tree removed earlier in the day leaned aggressively against the fascia of my roof with consequences.  true to his word, the vertex man repaired the injured roof, delaying his supper plans to dine with his wife for over an hour.

i love old fashioned integrity !  it clearly lives with respect to vertex roofing."
3477,"they rock, the honesty of rick the estimator was amazing.  as it turns out we didn't need a new roof just a few simple repairs.  would highly recommend them for their honestly alone.  very rare to find!"
3478,"we have terrible luck with repairs. for once we didn't!! anthony was very professional. the replacement was done properly and as fast as possible. he cleaned up after and respected our property. 

funny because we are also american home shield policy holders."
3479,"i like erie cafe but this place need renovation. it has wonderful location and specious but doesn't feel cozy. their branch in downtown cleveland is much more better.  

they offer cheesecake though but i didn't try it  !!!"
3480,"i am very happy, they treated me with a lot of integrity. it wasn't the fastest repair i have ever had but i am satisfied and would return."
3481,"problem was with a drain line pipe for the a/c and an a/c company that was just there said they couldn't fix it because it was a plumbing issue.  there was water leaking by the air handler in my condo rental that was on the bottom floor.

called precision plumbing on a sunday, spoke with a really nice & pleasant lady, and james was at my place within the hour.  the worst thing that he said to me was that it was not a plumbing issue.  he appeared to be dumbfounded that the a/c repair guy from the other company didn't resolve the problem.  james could have walked away and had a better day.  instead he called the owner of the company and because they also have an a/c repair side of their business, they told him what he could try to do.  he blew out the drain line, gunk came out, and water started dripping out of the proper area.  that's it!  problem solved and now i'm a life-long customer."
3482,"i called my home warranty company (ahs) this morning because my a/c was hesitating to start up and i saw the thermostat start to rise. before it got any worse, i knew i needed someone to fix it! luckily, the warrantee company contracts with grand canyon refrigeration!! martin called me within an hour after my call to ahs. he happened to be in my neighborhood on other jobs so he fit me into his schedule. he came out only 2 hours after my initial call!! on a holiday!! (4th of july). he was very friendly, pleasant, and professional. he wasnt like the other companies that i've had out here to fix my a/c over the years (other guys have been jerky salesmen and pretended to know about what they were doing). martin not only fixed my issue, he found that prior repairmen had put unnecessary parts onto my a/c unit!  i would trust him to fix my a/c if anything happened again. highly recommend!"
3483,"i have used this company on 4 different houses. i have found them to be reliable and ethical. from patio roof to leak repair they met expectations and were clear about what the challenges were of the repairs i asked for. 
they are quality contractors and the way you know this is because they are busy. beware the company that can start the job within the week."
3484,"cliff and his team of trustworthy professionals at all-star handyman helped me when i was abandoned by the builders of my unfinished room addition. after shoreline builders fled the scene, the el nino rains came and water was coming down the walls and out of my electrical outlet, i was devastated! cliff's team build a cricket on the roof that stopped the water from running inside the wall where the hip roofs met.

my french doors were left unpainted and warped. cliff's expertise painting and other work performed was unbeatable. he even threw in extra help for free.

it was sad to hear the negative review on this wonderful team. just for the record, $75 an hour on a holiday is a bargain. what company even goes out on christmas eve? most charge double if you can get anyone to come out at all. enough said, we love all-star handyman, cliff van winkle and his team are the best!"
3485,"have had asap do several doors for us, both repairs and new doors. we have always been very happy with the quality of the work and the quality of the doors. jim is very professional and does things right. the doors they sell are all higher quality so you dont have things like the doors cracking (which we had with another company) or coming apart. you wont regret using asap"
3486,"doug is really easy going and works quickly and efficiently.  his estimates are very fair (we are on a budget since we recently had a baby). he even fixed a door that wouldn't lock at no charge since it was such a ""quick fix ""! he put in several ceiling fans and recaulked our shower. i will be using him for all my future house repairs!"
3487,"i had chris repair an area where tile work, grout, sheet rock repair and painting was necessary.  he gave an accurate quote up front, did great work and completed the job faster than i expected.   i absolutely recommend!"
3488,"excellent sprinkler repair.  these guys know what they are doing.  on time, reasonable labor costs, and quick to get the job done.  highly recommend them."
3489,"my home was sold and i needed to repair 2 broken windows in time for close of escrow. i've called numerous glass company and none of them was able to order the glass in time. superior glass came to the rescue, they were so professional, efficient and most of all, the cheapest out of everyone. sonya was very responsive and pleasant. my windows were replaced and repaired within 2 days (a whole week before everyone else's quoted time). i totally endorse them and will recommend them to everyone."
3490,although the building is undergoing renovation the kale smoothies are spectacular! don't be put off by the construction and take your smoothie to go.
3491,"awesome company to deal with.  oleg was on-time, very professional and knowledgeable.  we highly recommend this company for television repair.  we have a mitsubishi dlp television, valleywide was able to get the part needed quickly and promptly scheduled the replacement once the part was received.  we'll be calling valleywide again for any future needs and will recommend to family and friends."
3492,"manuel reyes of just right masonry is our go-to guy for our masonry jobs.  he built a block wall around the perimeter of our house and did some repair work to the exterior walls of our block house.  

we're in the midst of a major remodel, and have dealt with a wide variety of contractors.  manny is always the best:  reliable, on time, on budget, and does incredible work.   if you need block, brick, or decorative stone work done, it doesn't get any better than just right masonry."
3493,"we went here about a month ago to get some tortillas since (la fama's) down the street was still closed due to renovations. la purisima is very very busy with a constant stream of customers coming in so they must be doing something right. we bought tortillas and some pastries and everything tasted great and fresh. freshness of their bakery products is what sets this place apart from other mexican bakeries. however, even though the tortillas were fresh and tasted good they still weren't as good as la fama's so since they are now open again we will continue to go to la fama's for our tortillas. however, la purisima is definitely a great spot for all your mexican bakery needs and wants. prices are cheap and everything fresh. definitely visit la purisima!"
3494,the renovation makes this location one of the nicest in town... perfect timing for the publix opening next door.
3495,"my go-to target. 
i've always had a good experience every time i've gone here. staff are helpful and it's always been clean when i've been here. like the starbucks renovation too!"
3496,this place was great and so much faster than those ones where they send it off site.  michael at i-repair is a doll and the turn around time was great.  he goes for the best solution for the least price and doesn't bs about the problem or push a new model at you.  great place!
3497,"these guys are great. honest, and helpful, and easy to work with. walked me through a fireplace repair, got things going. highly recommend."
3498,"i cannot say enough good things about our experience with grand canyon a/c and martin.  they were called out by our warranty company yesterday am and came within a few hours.  they worked with trane and fidelity and had the repair done the same day.  martin and his crew were professional, quick and got the job done!  i'm very impressed!"
3499,"we have been renters with invitation homes for just under a year now. and so far we have had nothing but good experiences. the office staff can at times be hard to get a hold of because they have 2,000 homes they are renting but they are fabulous when you do get a hold of them. they have always been quick to respond when ever anything was wrong with the house and the handymen are top notch professionals who have always been quick and friendly. it's also awesome to have their online portal to pay bills with. overall i will only use invitation homes in the future when i rent a home in las vegas because all their staff is so professional, timely and easy to work with."
3500,"i've been going to crossfit cle for the last 2 years and i've been 100% satisfied with the equipment, coaching and scheduling.

the coaches are extremely knowledgeable and work with all skill levels from beginner to average to beast. i've never been a great athlete, but i've seen huge gains in performance and strength since committing to as little as 3 x 1 hr wods each week. if you're looking to mix-up your workout routine or simply start one, i recommend coming in to talk to the coaches about trying out a wod.

there's also been major renovations in the past year -- new floor, new pull-up apparatus, new rowers, more ghd sit-up equipment and plates/bars for lifting. plus there are well-maintained bathroom facilities with showers.

i can't praise this place enough!"
3501,i called saturday morning just as they were opening to see if they could send a technician out to repair our broken dryer. joy was friendly and efficient in getting me scheduled. the technician jon came out just a few hours after i called. he was friendly and efficient in fixing our dryer. i would highly recommend them to any of my friends and family.
3502,"i called travis after reading all the rave reviews here on yelp. he was exactly as everyone wrote about him. don't bother with any other company for garage door repair, go straight to hns for an honest quote and excellent work. my garge door is working better than ever before. thank you travis!!"
3503,"fast, friendly,  fair and honest. was told repair was going to be 2 hours, they were done early. highly recommend."
3504,"brought some old jewelry over for a checkup and repaired parts and a few minutes later, i left with very secure clasps and loops and the same amount of money in my pocket... i checked out their selection of jewelry while i was there and could see a great variety and quality -- guess where i will go for any future jewelry purchases or needs!"
3505,"dave's response time to my initial inquiry was impressive. 

he provided an approximate time of arrival, kept me informed and arrived on time. 

once he arrived, i presented dave with a tricky repair in a difficult location.  he found a solution quickly and completed the job very professionally. 

i felt his rates were reasonable too.

based on my experience with garrett plumbing (dave garrett), i would recommend his company."
3506,"stanley was recommenced to me by a friend who has had several repairs made by him. i sent him a text in the evening and he replied the next morning asking if i could text a picture of my problem. with in minutes he gave me a quote and a time when he could do the work since it wasn't urgent. his work was neat, efficient, reasonable and high quality. couldn't ask for more. stanley has my business."
3507,"can't say enough good things about phend and clint. clint came out to fix some clanking pipes that other contractors had said were unfixable without some major and expensive repairs. clint was incredibly thorough about diagnosing the problem and was creative enough to come up with a totally ""non-invasive"" and inexpensive solution to the problem. super honest, super helpful, super friendly. thumbs up!"
3508,"tod wever responded promptly to a problem with a bathroom floor repair that had been done by their handyman.   i discovered the problem when the tenant moved out and reported it to him immediately.    he kindly offered a refund on the charges so that i could have the work re-done since i had decided to keep the condo for my own use.    he was prompt, pleasant, and understanding in our conversations and i was happy with the end result."
3509,"just beautiful.  

summer or any other sunny days are obviously the best time to wander about the stone mad patio.  it's a great atmosphere with tables and benches and also high tables better for mingling.  the restaurant is nice, as it's broken up into a few different dining areas as well as a rather large bar area when you first enter. 

i took my mom here as she really appreciates patios and anything outdoor, however it was very cold and very rainy on the day that we had planned.  it wasn't the same sitting at a table inside and not really enjoying anything outdoors aside from looking out the window.  so, what do i do?  give her a tour of the bathroom.  well, actually, the door man walked us downstairs, into the women's room, and talked with us for a good 20 minutes about the tile in there as well as all the renovations that were made.  as well as his childhood.  it was uncomfortably hysterical.  probably the best part of the dining experience.

when you go, make sure to inquire, or at least appreciate all of the fine details from the sinks in the bathroom to the doorknobs.  they put a lot of thought into the beauty of this place; and they're so not even done yet."
3510,"i would definitely recommend sunland to anyone. i had been having problems with my ac for a couple years, and had dealt with another company that only wanted to come out and sell me repairs i didn't need and still not fix the issue. marty came out at 6am and had me fixed up in no time. very reasonable rates, honest, and not just trying to sell me crap i don't need. going through what i've been through the last couple of years, it is very refreshing to find a company that it interested in helping people. top notch! thanks again"
3511,"the best.   i am relatively new to the las vegas area and my garage door wouldn't open this morning. panic set in. a friend of mine recommended first call garage doors...702 371 3882.   i spoke with ryan in the morning, and jeremy in the same  afternoon came out and fixed it. no fuss no muss. very happy with their promptness,  and their great attitude and their efficiency. i would recommend them to everybody who needs repair on their garage doors."
3512,"they gave me a very fair estimate for the repairs and did the job right. did more than was quoted and didn't charge extra. very friendly, professional, and courteous. i highly recommend them and would use them again in the future. a+"
3513,it's a pretty average gym that offers so many different kinds of classes just wish that they offered more morning classes especially on my way to work. they have a five minute policy in making a class which is a bummer because i could only squeeze in a 30 minute workout most days and can't make it on time . there's about to be a renovation in some areas which is definitely needed like the women's sauna room . glad they have separate sauna rooms for men and women y
3514,juan showed up on time and did a professional job. he was very helpful while describing the work he did and what repairs might be needed in the future. i would recommend collin's comfort masters for your ac needs.
3515,the wings are super hot and flavorful! their items are expensive but worth it. also the restaurant is in disrepair but still a cool place to visit on the south side.
3516,"absolutely wonderful!  i was told by another company that i needed a new air conditioner and mine could not be repaired.  darrien came out and said it could be repaired. i got a call later that said, that not only could it be repaired but the part that needed to be repaired was under warranty and the cost was going to be about half.  i went from paying $8,000 for a replacement to $1,600 for a repair. i'll be using them again.  don't fool around with another company, it's not worth it."
3517,zach was my repairman he was the best! i would recommend him & cassel to anyone! he was friendly explained things very well & checked out my heating unit. i called my son afterwards & told him that cassel was the place to go for repairs!
3518,they emailed quickly with my request for an appointment.  danny called when he was 15 minutes out .  he explained the problem clearly and in a way i could understand.  he explained the cost in a clear manner.  danny was quick and courteous.  i would call them again when i need repairs.
3519,"i called collins after getting a bill of $1200.00 to repair a clogged condensation line from another ac company. collins came out the very same day, unclogged the drain within 10 minutes and did not hit me up with any unnecessary repairs. very honest technician. thanks don"
3520,"today was my first time using michael & son.  it was a great experience.  jonathan came out. he was friendly,walked me through the issue and provided me with multiple options. once repairs were completed he walked me through everything he had done and answered all my questions."
3521,"just had a great repair done by robert g. he was very fast, friendly, and patient in explaining  what he did to fix the hose issue in the bathroom. i would definitely request him if he's available should any other plumbing problems arise. thanks, robert! :)"
3522,"this was so much fun! there are so many different ways to have a great time in this city--you just have to know what you are into and where to find your adventure. i chose countdown live escape games (countdown) as a fun father's day activity. we wanted to do something interactive and experience something new. a mystery room seemed to fit the bill.

the room was wanted, sherlock, was booked for the whole day so we chose the project poseidon. it's their newer sci-fi room experience that requires teamwork, communication, and openness. we loved it. 

no, the four of us did not get out of the room, but it's the hardest one so i don't feel too bad about that fact. we laughed and worked together to try to escape the toughest room countdown had to offer (my excuse for not escaping) and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  

what i loved: the complexity of the room; the helpfulness of the staff; the thoughtfulness required

what i didn't love: the disrepair of some parts of the room; the warmth of the room"
3523,larry is flexible and always friendly.  i love his style and my girl that works there. i take all my jewelry  for repairs.
3524,i contacted brookside on a thursday.  keith came to my home the next morning on time at 7:30 am.  he quickly diagnosed the problem in my irrigation box and repaired the sprinkler system.  i paid $125 which was lower than the $350 quote i got from another landscaping company.
3525,i love this gym. it is great for morning training and the staff is incredibly friendly. the prices are great and i never have to wait for equipment. it is in good condition and repair.
3526,rush and the team did a great job with our roofdeck. they were very busy but were able to get us on the schedule. they arrived on time and finished the deck when they said they would. we would recommend him for any of your roofdeck needs. super friendly. he answered all of our questions and concerns. cost for repairs were super reasonable and didn't break the bank.  two thumbs up!!!

3528,"john the manager was very helpful, friendly and loves yelp! great place for any of your jewelry repairs."
3529,"so far so good. i found fowler on yelp and their response time was super quick, within a few minutes of my initial contact. they were able to set up a next day appointment for me. jeremiah was the technician who met me for a walk behind after a home inspection. he was very down to earth, professional and honest. he seems like a trustworthy guy, there to make repairs and not nickel and dime you. this is much appreciated. i'm sure the work will be of high quality too. a review to follow repairs."
3530,i took my daughter's broken nintendo 3ds to ubreakifix for repair.  they were great about communication and kept me informed every step of the way.  super nice and friendly.  my daughter is thrilled to have a working 3ds again!  i will definitely return as a customer.
3531,"easiest real estate experience i've had. i was being hounded by wholesalers based on an estate situation. i called mike out of the blue based on his great reviews and he immediately jumped to helping me. he saved me a ton of money, and got the price range i was looking for. his team very responsive and helpful (thanks michelle). he used a great title company. lastly, he handled the necessary repairs without me needing to be in town and made it seamless for me. incredible experience. thanks mike!"
3532,"i've had travis at my house several times. he has replaced two ceiling fans, light switches and installed a ham radio antenna on my house. i've found him to be professional, through, and very reliable. 
i highly recommend handy dandy dalton aka travis for any of your handyman needs."

3536,so fast!! jay from econolight came by to repair and install gfci outlets throughout the house. he was super friendly and did a great job! best of all he worked so fast so we could get on with the rest of our busy day. jay is awesome would definitely recommend!
3537,well i just moved into this place and i have called the office and advised that my peep hole needed to be fixed. not only did maintenance come and repair it but they also replaced the light at my front doors entrance. thank you so much.
3538,"add me to the list of positive reviews..my '93 dakota had failed the pressure test several times..i ran out of time and patience, and took it to ee for repair...the pressure test test is $100, and they fixed it with no extra charges."
3539,"this is a quality place. i was told the truth about the repairs, the cost and the timeline. it is a very clean place with friendly staff. i will not hesitate to use them again or recommend them!"
3540,"these guys did much needed repair of the drywall throughout our house 2 years ago. texture match was excellent and overall superb work.  this was the only part of our kitchen re-modelling / house overhaul that went well. 

the drywall work is still holding up great in the 2+  years since they were here..

highly recommend these guys

update 11/1/2017.  had these folks come through to do some additional repairs inside and outside the house plus garage ceiling. excellent work and superb matching to existing texture. chris and his guys do excellent work    highly recommended"
3541,"repairs were completed without extras and within time constraints.  two repairs at a rental property secured them the job at my own home.  a little pricey today for rodding out my shower drain but then again, i called at 8:30 saturday morning, was promised 1-3pm and they're here and gone at 11:45am which worked with my schedule just fine! yay!!

good job guys."
3542,"mario was great. he was flexible with my work schedule & understanding when i had to reschedule. mario evaluated my washer and explained what could possibly be wrong along w/ repair options vs. prices, depending on what further evaluation revealed. i was able to make an informed decision based upon his eatimates. the repair was completed quickly and i couldn't be happier!"
3543,"i had a great experience today with collins comfort masters. right from the start, my technician, travis, entered my house and put booties on his feet! what a nice touch. he then checked my unit and gave me a thorough, honest diagnostic. it's a 16 year old unit and i expected to be told that it is going to blow up at any minute. he did explain some of the faulty areas (which did not come as a surprise), but did not push to sell me parts or repairs. he gave me a realistic picture of what's going on and made his recommendations with no pressure. i can appreciate that. bottom line, if your looking for an honest assessment with a classy operation, give collins comfort masters a try. you won't be disappointed."
3544,"most knowlegable club repair guys in town. my son plays jr golf all over the u.s. and we only trust these guys for regripping, re-shafting and repair."
3545,my heater quit working. i called and was a bit anxious because i heard ac repair guys just want to sell you a new ac. the guy came out (the same day) and told me the part was one that wears out and is common and inexpensive. he got the part the same day and i had heat again! so happy. the best part was there was no sales pitch. i will definitely use this company again!
3546,"i needed a glass panel replaced in a sliding door and these guys were awesome. great pricing, super friendly all around from the scheduler to the technician, and the repair looks great. would definitely use them again and am going to recommend them to others!"
3547,"calvin is one of the most honest and hard working a/c and heating repair guys in the business. when your a/c goes out you don't have a lot of time to mess around with quotes so don't waste a lot of time and just with the best first. he offers great warranties and does the job himself, so he stands by it. you can't go wrong trusting calvin with all your refrigeration needs."
3548,i have used shawn at desert mountain roofing for about 5 years now and with numerous clients. has not let anyone down. he has done a complete re-roof to small leaks and repairs. good communication and very dependable.
3549,"needed help with my a/c after i tried to do it myself. i called up spoke with zoue set up a time and their i go. he not only fixed the repair i tried to do, but saved me some money by not having to by a new compressor and using the part i had bought for my vw jetta. very honest man, he earned a customer for life here. just in time for this az heat too."
3550,"i called this company since there were so many great yelp reviews. i am adding my own praise now!  steve showed up the same day i called to check the air conditioner's problem. he knew immediately what the problem was. i felt he was very knowledgeable and trustworthy. in this town, knowing an honest air conditioner repair person is worth its weight in gold."
3551,"had a great time at the ping factory today. eric was a great club fitter and took the time to explain to me what a real ping golf club looks like, as i found out today i have been swinging a knock off set for the last 4 years. after a few laughs he went through every part of the fitting and took time to explain every adjustment. he then walked me over to the repair portion of the factory and helped me get set up to repair the one and only legit ping club i had! thanks eric! i will be investing in a new set of g30's very soon!"
3552,"they ordered the parts i needed before they came out. repairman, alonzo was amazing-- fast and efficient. the big problem turned out to be small and the 600$ repair i was quoted from another place turned out to be $231. i will use them again!"
3553,update: the bacon has been repaired!! we have ordered it 2 times since my first review and it was perfect! still 4.5 stars but with zero complaints this time. if you have read any of my reviews you would be impressed by this one..
3554,vetsbuilt recently repaired my patio roof and replaced a water heater. bob was friendly and agreeable to a few scheduling changes. the estimates he gave were spot on. i would recommend them and use them again.
3555,"i had some broken tiles on my roof (sand type tiles,) that needed replacement jbs roofing came out inspected the roof told me that i needed a new vulcanized coating over my patio.  the home is11yrs old so i felt they did me a hugh favor by mentioning that to me.  to make a long story short,  they came out with a special crew to install the sand cast tiles.   about 2 1/2 months later my son on vacation found a chip of stucco had been gouged out of a waist high wall.  i called jbs roofing on monday, darian was out at our home tuesday morning.  he repaired the gouge.  no questions asked, no saying that jbs roofing wasn't responsible, he just fixed it, and he did it with a smile.  i would gladly recommend jbs roofing for all your roofing issues.

3556,"republic west remodeling recently did a renovation of the master bathroom in our home. after the death of my father, my mother came to live with us. she has some physical issues, and we needed to create a handicap accessible bathroom for her. 
i felt this would be a challenging project, but the team at republic west remodeling were amazing. from the the initial design process, to picking out fixtures and materials, to the actual construction, the republic west team walked us through each step and let us know what to expect. we had a detailed schedule. we knew who was coming to our home, and when. every person who came to our home was professional and courteous. i have had nightmare experiences with other contractors in the past, but i can't say enough about my experience with republic west remodeling. the finished project is beautiful. the bathroom is fully ada compliant. it is perfect for my mother's needs, but it still looks gorgeous. republic west remodeling did amazing work for our family, and i look forward to using them for our next project."
3557,"wow i cannot begin to say enough about this company!!! everyone i interacted with through the process of my air condition repair was professional, friendly, time in response and communicative.  jim was timely and worked hard to repair my ac & get my home cool again.

i highly recommend this company."
3558,i was there last week for a hernia repair and stayed overnight. i couldn't have been any happier with my nurses. especially night nurse jeremy and morning nurse marilyn! both were very thoughtful and understanding about post surgical pain and lack of mobility.
3559,i'm really surprised at the poor reviews on this company.  i've used dino's to repair my bosch dishwasher and counter depth fridge.  they were pleasant and reliable to deal with and thought the pricing reasonable.
3560,"if you need outdoor lighting installed or maintenance of existing systems as i did, todd and patrick are outstanding. what i especially appreciate is todd's honesty in showing you what is available but recommending what you actually need. while he could have simply recommended high end replacement of my systems, he explained what they could do but recommended lower end repairs to maintain my existing systems until such time as i want to upgrade or the systems deteriorate to the point they have to be redone.  and when that time comes or for any other maintenance, i will absolutely call todd.  and for the amount of time spent and needed parts that todd and patrick used as well as the high quality of their work, the cost was very reasonable. great guys, great company."
3561,"hopefully i won't have to come for repairs, again...my tech was jose. very helpful and very knowledgable."
3562,"seriously excellent company. got to us on short notice, came right on time and had the parts to repair our samsung dryer with them. other companies wouldn't even touch samsung. 

rom is super friendly, knowledgeable and honest. our dryer just had a couple of wheels on the drum that needed replacing and he had it fixed in no time. definitely call them up and don't go anywhere else."
3563,"an ancient compressor (chrysler 1973) on my older a/c unit failed.  mark came out in the evening and went straight to work diagnosing the failed part just to be sure it was dead.  he tested everything and indeed it was dead.  every other contractor just looked at it and supposed it was dead.  mark actually tested the power, grounds, caps etc.

he gave me a very competitive written proposal for repairs.  in the end i used another provider due to a very long relationship with that person (but at a higher price).  

i would use and recommend mark again at any time."
3564,"i have been there many times, it is fast, inexpensive, and tasty. they have done renovation not too long ago, so the place doesn't look cheap.  it is always busy, i love their congee and bbq poke..."
3565,"the only ""guys"" that would show up. between sending a pic and getting a quote, which they stuck too, did repair timely and professionally. the price and repair was first rate and highly recommend. they sent a invoice by email, one click to pay, one click to get receipt. seamless and painless."
3566,"timur did it again... the heater stopped working in my rental.  apparently the only problem was something needed to be tightened... most repairmen would lie and make it a big deal, but not timur.  the most honest guy out there! i'm a customer for life!"
3567,"this is my favourite place to go for gelato, and seriously the renovations they did to this place is gorgeous. my all time favourite flavour is hk milk tea really tastes authentic and a great twist of asian flavours with gelato. really creative place and love that they are always trying to improve :)"
3568,kevin was a wonderful repairman/contractor for our home repairs.  we have worked with him twice and he's been professional and responsive. we had some house repairs on the exterior and some inside repairs as well.  he gave us a fair estimate and he worked quickly. we appreciate how he was responsive and helpful.
3569,great company to rent from. cindi and shannon have been most helpful at getting moved in to the house and any repairs that have had to be made.
3570,stefan is the best. he spends the time to figure out the source of the problem and double-checks all related issues. then his repairs are meticulous.
3571,"love their recent renovations, the place looks a lot better now! usually i get the signature pork belly or their spicy squid and cheese fondue, but this time i opted for the pork intestines. although i feel that it wasn't as good as the pork belly, it was still pretty good if you are in the mood for something more fatty."
3572,"loved it here.

i found out today that the upper level noodle bar is permanently shut down? i'm very sad about this as i was looking forward to its reopening since the news of it being under renovations for the past few months now.

does anyone know why it is being shut down and if there are plans for it being open anywhere else in the city?"
3573,"josh came out diagnosed problem - evaporative fan motor , ordered the part and did repair after two days!

i had another company come out through american home shield- air pro master and they where terrible!!

josh was excellent!! thank you air squad. no excuses and no hassles"
3574,"johnny did great work for us on a number of minor repairs. he was very responsive, always on time, and communicative. i would hire him again!"
3575,"this place now has five dollar tuesdays! the seating is so comfortable,
love it! the renovations are new and everything now looks up to date."
3576,alaskan pulls through again.  turns out i ended up with a defective unit! they repaired it a few times but ultimately they contacted the manufacturer  on my behalf and got me a new unit.
3577,"this company came to my home to repair my refridgerator. my first impression was that they both had a clean and neat appearance. ferdinand stood out by showing his skills and abilities right away. he took his time to explain in detail the problems we were facing and exactly how much it would cost to fix. on the other hand, it was obvious to me that the so called ""owner"" had no idea how things worked and even stood by arguing with ferdinand while he did all the work. at one point robert, the owner, even tried to sell me parts that i know i did not need in order to make a profit for himself! i could tell the employee, ferdinand, was humiliated because he excuse himself to go outside while robert berated my wife and i about the need to pay extra for things we didn't need. 5 stars for ferdinand. if he had his own company i would hire him every time. 0 stars for that piece of $%\t robert. thank you for reading."
3578,"the,best repair experience! so knowledgeable and honest. no haggling :) will definitely recommend for mt friends and any future repairs!"
3579,"being in the construction business, i truly appreciate integrity and professionalism when it comes to the building trades. chris went above and beyond for us when we discovered a leak in our master bath ceiling, that we thought might be from the air handler in our attic, only turned out to be the plumbing. i called him at 4:30 pm and he was able to respond within 10 minutes. thanks to photos that our hvac guy gave us of the situation, he diagnosed the part and arrived at 7 pm to make the repair. i'm so happy to have found a reliable and trustworthy plumber in cave creek!"
3580,awesome experience! very honest company! my heater wasn't working and the company arrived within 2 hours. the diagnostic showed that my heater wasn't working due to dirty air vents. they did not try to overstate the issue and charge for unnecessary repairs. i am very satisfied and will be using this company again!
3581,"i needed a seal specialist for my maytag frig.  they sent out cornelio who i found to be knowledgeable and honest. ultimately no repair needed at this time. saved me $ by not doing an unnecessary repair. thanks, cornelio!"
3582,jeremy is a true professional. he was able to help me in an urgent case with my main irritation shut off valve that i broke and repaired the irrigation system as well. trustworthy and fair.
3583,i called kilter to get a quote on a mini-split unit because of poor air flow in my master bedroom.  brett diagnosed the real cause of the problem and fixed it that day at a significantly lower cost than what 3 other ac companies quoted who didn't even bother to find out why i was getting no air in the room.  boy i wish i called them years ago instead of believing other ac repair guys who said there wasn't much i could do about the problem.
3584,a & r (egor) came to my home on the same day that i put in my request to my home warranty. he immediately diagnosed the problem with my ac unit and repaired it.
3585,professional and efficient re-keying. technician took the time to ensure that all locks were replaced and advised on repair recommendations for doors. will do business again!
3586,love coming here whenever i'm in the area! i usually just get the gelato and haven't tried their other items but seriously so good!! the renovations made the place so much more cuter and the gelato still doesn't disappoint. my favourite would be the sesame peanut?? i think that's what it's called lol -- either way i'm a fan and will always be returning!
3587,"whenever i call, they show up and have the issue fixed the same day! pricing is comparable to that of other local plumbers that we've used in our other homes and they have never tried to talk me into unnecessary repairs. derek does an excellent job!"
3588,this is by far the most professional irrigation company in the valley.  we have been using think green to repair our aging irrigation system and they quickly find the source of the problem and fix it like new.  they also installed new landscaping lighting for us.  the best!!
3589,"kitchen and bath recently did a renovation of my kitchen and two bathrooms, and i must say that i am very happy with their work! everyone that i dealt with was very professional and pleasant to work with. i would certainly recommend them to anyone wanting to upgrade their kitchen or bathroom."
3590,easily one of the best companies i have worked with here in az.  todd was super helpful and responsive to my issue and patrick was phenomenal as well with the repair i needed.  i would highly recommend using these guys for any outdoor lighting need!!!
3591,good neighborhood repair place worth giving a try. owner is a sweet older gentleman.
3592,i can't put in words how much of a lifesaver these guys are.   i had them come for a $39 inspection of all the ac heater and duct system in a home i was in the process of buying.   little did i know there was so much mickey mouse stuff done on the attic ducts that it would cost $6000 to repair.  these guys are lifesavers.    thanks scott !
3593,"i needed 5 sofa pillows repaired after becoming chew toys for my puppy. sergio was able to provide a quote using photos i sent! his prices were great, turnaround time was fast and the pillows look brand new! highly recommend!"
3594,"roofs arizona is a very good, dependable roofing contractor. bob was quick to respond, covered everything that would need to be done, made recommendations, and and arrived on time to complete the repairs. do not hesitate to contact bob for any roofing repairs.

3595,"i have been relying on savage air conditioning for years for maintenance, for repairs and for installation of new equipment.  in every case, they have done a professional, thorough and reliable job.  i have never felt they were pushing unneeded repairs or new equipment but rather working with me to get the most from my current equipment as long as possible.  they are always on-time and personable.  i trust them completely.  i cannot imagine using anyone else."
3596,these guys do kitchen and bathroom renovations differently. instead of selling you cabinetry they do turn key rental with their own contractors and material. very large and impressive showroom and knowledgeable staff that offer designs for your job. i am very happy with them.
3597,"harold just finished working on my garage door opener - i cannot say enough good things about him. he is so professional, efficient, and courteous. he was here at the top of the hour of the 2 hr window. he was very patient in explaining what needed to be done. i am a happy customer of precision garage door repair."
3598,business has a great inventory of replacement parts. staff was fantastic in solving my blind repair!
3599,"i have used these guys many times over many years and they do really excellent work. true, they can be quite expensive and they can take their time but i find they stick to their estimates and as i said they do great work. many examples. i had two large tumi bags  that were in rough shape but worth renabilitating, and after some repairs and reconditioning, like new. thick leather jackets others can't handle, no problem. i even like the experience and sense of humour, but to each his own."
3600,"found them on yelp, and they were the fastest, most straight forward home repair/maintenance company that i've ever used.  this is saying a lot, as i've been an homeowner for nine years now.  i've used referrals, angie's list, other online reviews, and got really lucky with finding steel city garage doors this time.  they are quick, responsive, professional, honest, and efficient.

stop your search and call them now!"
3601,glad i called ultra!!  i called them to get a 2nd opinion on a diagnosis we got from another company who came out and spent 10 minutes looking at our unit.  just to be sure i decided to get a 2nd opinion and called ultra. they responded fast and was able to come to my house the next day.  when the technician arrived he was polite and professional.  he took his time looking at everything and taking pictures to show us what he was seeing as our unit is in the ceiling.  he also sent us the pictures.  we received an honest and thorough diagnosis and gave us the most cost effective options and even suggested going through our home owners warranty.  i highly recommended ultra to anyone needing this type of repair.
3602,mike and chad got to my house super quick after calling them and they saved me from a potential costly repair.  no doubt they accept any challenge and stay until the job is done!
3603,the repair was done on my bmw in such a timely manner and at a reasonable cost! they explained what was wrong and got straight to it. the staff also gave me a ride to and from work since the repair would take most of the work day. highly recommended!
3604,"we had our fridge go out.ronald came by and advised it was the condenser...he replaced part,also cleaned up after himself.....we also had them repair a power cable on our oven.....rom also came by to help out...they both were very professional ....and know there job....thank you
from saving us the expense of a new refrigerator......will use them again...."
3605,"we recently purchased a new ac/heating system from collins comfort masters.  it was a pleasant experience from start to finish.  we picked up the brochure at costco on a monday.  on tuesday neil chrisney came to our house and gave us a quote on what we would need and on thursday they had the system installed.  from neil, to our installers, daniel, justin, tyler, and i can't come up with the 4th ones name, they were all a pleasure to work with.  they were all professional, showed up on time and were very thorough.  they had to cut a hole through our wall upstairs to get the air handler up into the attic.  they had stewart contact us and the hole was repaired on the following tuesday.  so from start to finish it was one week.  we will definitely contact them for any future needs and recommend them to our friends."
3606,"in one week i had a problem with my sink leaking into my kitchen cabinet and shower leaking from top floor damaging the ceiling in my dining room. i called dossey and they were incredibly responsive. i sent a pic of the parts needed, they ordered and repaired both in the same week. knowledgeable, thorough and respectful repair experts.  highly recommend!!"
3607,best hvac company in charlotte. i had an issue they found the issue and repaired on the same day..
3608,couldn't be happier! i've been moved in for about 7 months now and this process was so easy with their help! only needed one repair & they handled it the moment i told them. recommending to all my friends and family forsure
3609,"i have been coming to this place for years, and frank has never disappoint me. he is the only person i trust with my repairs."
3610,you can count on platinum restoration.  when the wind blew and power went off and basement stopped draining... platinum was there.  they will let you know what is needed to be done and the timeline of the repairs.  recommended.
3611,"what a renovation should be!

we just had five40 remodeling in to repair what another contractor ruined. we wish we had found shannon and his crew earlier. very professional, very honest and very good. his guys are great (thanks scott). they do what they say they are going to do, they clean up each day and are a pleasure to deal with. we can't recommend them enough!"
3612,"i would use them again if needed. i had an email response within a few minutes and responses were also quick.
my repairman was danny and he was always punctual and eager to make the repairs
on our first visit the part was not available in town, he said 2 days. he called the next morning and said he could make time that day. he wanted to work with my schedule to get the repairs done.
happy with the whole experience"
3613,johnny came to my rescue and fixed a botched job! i had some new plumbing installed and those contractors did an unprofessional job finishing the drywall repair and re-texture. i called johnny yesterday and he came today. he fixed it and i'm very happy with his work and will be calling him again for my next project.  i highly recommend!!
3614,"timely response, repaired unit when other contractors wanted to sell me a new one."
3615,"david showed up right at 8am as scheduled, was very professional, got to work diagnosing the heater & had it repaired within the hour for a reasonable fee. a great 1st experience with this company. i'll call them in the future."
3616,"phend plumbing is the best. any time we feel panic or worry about our water or pipes, we know who to call. 

most recently, i was worried that i was having a leak in my ceiling. pete came out the same day, and explained what was actually happening (no leak, whew!) pete is always on time, and generally comes out the same day that i call.  the best thing is that he's always honest. he takes time to explain how thing work, why or why not a repair might be needed, and i never feel like his fees are unfair. 

we've used phend plumbing for years now, at multiple houses, and he's always been professional and courteous, taking time to help us understand each situation. his understanding of homes and plumbing is of top notch, which is a great comfort to us non-plumbers.

and guess what, our whole extended family uses phend plumbing, too - my parents, my sister, and even our cousins call pete. we refer him to all of our friends when they're looking for a plumber, and he treats everyone that we refer to him as if they were his own family. i highly recommend him for any time you need a plumber.  you won't be sorry."
3617,"they do a great job on repairs, sometimes even making repairs while i wait.  always very friendly and helpful."
3618,"disagree with the previous. had a good experience.
*parts to repair was recommended
liked it over replacement, thanks."
3619,holtzman did a wonderful job with our remodel. we had a loft added along with major renovation throughout the rest of the house. we had a constant line of communication and the end was just beautiful. all of the employees were very professional and the site was always left clean.
3620,"quick response and even came out on a sunday morning! was able to diagnose what was wrong with our fridge and was very honest with the repair and cost. unfortunately, the repair would be more than what we paid for the refrigerator but he gave us great places and recommendations on where to purchase a new one and what brand(s) were good!"
3621,"adrian guerrero came out today to repair our garage door.  we are extremely happy with the repair.  adrian was professional, timely and made sure we tried the door and were happy before leaving.  we would highly recommend adrian guerrero to anyone in need of garage door repairs.  thanks, adrian."
3622,"holtzman came out and quickly repaired a drawer, cabinets and with the time left, offered to help assemble a dining room table!  they were sure to work the full hour charged, were neat and very professional.  i will use them again, they gave me a great quote on some painting too."
3623,"awesome work! dave was very knowledgable, helped get my fountain functioning properly with a new beckett motor and tiers level.  highly recommend dave for any all fountain repairs, very fast and reasonable."
3624,"steve laramee is perfection! was on time to my parents home, fixed it right the first time, honest, honest!! will use him every time we have need for repairs. highly recommend, couldn't have picked a better person. 
thanks!
from, 
the blankenships"
3625,"i sent in a request for a quote on a microwave to 4 different companies. three of them told me that they were going to charge me a fee just to come look and if they couldn't figure it out then i still have to pay them. 

laron the owner of loe's messaged me that based on my request a description he knew what the problem was and that it would be better to just buy a new one. i have never had a repair person be so upfront and honest. if you want someone knowledgeable to be honest with you then use loe's."
3626,"roswell does great work. it's very difficult to find anyone who does binding any longer. i had a collection of old blues records that came in a book style sleeve. the binding had completely come apart. they repaired in a day. yes it's expensive but one has to ask themselves how much is your time worth tracking someone who does this type of work and does it well. trust me, i think there are two places in the valley. i searched for well over two weeks."
3627,"doug's awesome! as an out of state property owner, it's often difficult to find and trust people to complete home repairs. we contacted doug and he showed up (huge props for that in itself!), assessed the issue with the garbage disposal and had it fixed in no time. thank you doug! peace of mind is invaluable."
3628,i called and was scheduled an appointment the following morning. rom came and repaired our freezer fairly quickly. he was very professional and friendly!
3629,"i've hired josh & renewed painting for multiple jobs and consider them my go-to painters for life! first of all, josh is an excellent painter and is very skilled. he's painted cabinets, doors, walls, trim, concrete patio, and stencils for me, and they're all flawless. drywall repair and matching textured walls was perfection. he's also a really good guy -- funny, professional, patient, and easy to get along with. josh has taken my residence and rental properties and made them look brand new with paint alone. i'll hire him again and again and know you'll love him, too."
3630,"our tech, joel # 816, showed up on time and was able to fix our jenn air refrigerator.  he answered all our questions and was very knowledgeable.  he even offered suggestions to help avoid significant future repair expenses."

3633,"alan did a fantastic job on my bmw. it was a large and i think a difficult repair. his price was very fair. he kept chipping away at the smallest areas until they were perfect. i really can't tell there was ever a big pushed in area.

thanks alan

3634,it's hard to find people to come out for small jobs these days. rick responded quickly to my request came out gave me a quote and actually showed up when he said he would and completed the job. i would use rick again for drywall installation and repair.
3635,"i actually didn't use this company. i called when my 2-year-old refrigerator failed. i left a message on a sunday and later received a same day call for scheduling. i was transferred to a technician whom i forgot his name. after asking me a few questions about the model/make of the item, he suggested me to call the manufacturer based on his experience. i assumed if i didn't buy an extended warranty, my refrigerator repair is not covered. thanks to his advise, i was able to have  the manufacturer to send their contractor to fix the major issue (compression failure) for free. this would otherwise cost way over $500. 

so what you get from my experience?
1. this company is very responsive. same day respond on a sunday. 
i called other companies as well but didn't get a reply 2 days later. 
2. technician is very knowledgeable and honest. 

this is certainly a company you want to do business with. it's 5 stars for a reason."

3639,"terry hind arrived promptly at the stated time. our issue was that the bathroom shower was not getting any cold water so was too hot to use.  he diagnosed the problem right away.  when he went to turn off the water at the outside shut-off valve, he found it was too corroded to shut off.  i had to call the city to have the main turned off and terry was very accommodating to go buy the needed parts while we waited.  the repairs were made in good time and to our complete satisfaction."

3643,"our air conditioning unit was starting and stopping all the time.  had another company look at it, they said the compressor needed to be replaced: $2.700, they suggested it would even be better to replace the whole unit: $4.522.  as the unit is only 6 years old and i heard some weird stories about amps and gas, i decided to get a second opinion from black mountain air.  their technician was very professional and honest.  the compressor was just fine, there was no need to replace it at all.  the only thing that had to be replaced was the capacitor: $229 for parts and labour.  the unit is running fine now and all tests after repair are perfect.  thank you guys!"
3644,"jedin bianchi came to my home today to tune my 55-year-old spinet piano.  he was prompt, and communicated well about his arrival time.  he was very friendly and personable, and did a terrific job tuning our piano.  we'll be calling him every time we need tuning or repair.  thanks, jedin!"

3669,my renovation was one bathroom and a kitchen. johnny did a great job at helping me through the design process.  grace was very good at picking out the color scheme and  materials that compliment each other.   we did go through 3 foreman's ... which caused a delay.  however the response were quick and it only ran over by about a month... for remodel i think that's probably standard.  all of the people who came to my house did an excellent job and cleaned up after each step.  i felt the detail from each specialty was incredible.

3681,"aas definitely lives up to the hype!  we had a fridge go down overnight and we wanted to try and save it.  spoke with jon in the office and was able to make an appointment very easily.  rom showed up and diagnosed what would be needed to get it up and running.  not only was he very specific and knowledgable about what was needed, but he was also very honest and understanding when i decided that it cost too much to repair versus just buying a new one.  i will forever recommend these guys for all future repair needs."
3682,"i have used this place for years like 15. 
my husband is super picky & we have never had a problem. 
we are always satisfied with the word and if we ever need a button or repair we just ask and it is done. 
great hours and a drive thru is super easy."

3685,"over the last two weeks, we've been working with anthony to diagnose a rather mysterious issue with our refrigerator. he had to visit us 3 times in total and every single time, he was on time (actually early 2 of the 3 times - he called to make sure that was ok), professional, personable, reasonable, and determined to figure the issue out. he fought for fair treatment when the parts company sold us a broken part and quickly performed every repair attempt. i can't say enough for how much we appreciate his efforts. no less than 5 stars will do. he earned them all. thanks, anthony!"
3686,matt is great.  on time and thorough.  couldn't ask for a more honest and straight forward garage repair man.  absolutely recommend
3687,"okay folks! my refrigerator was leaking water like crazy and i am not savvy with fixing them. i yelped to find a repair place and this place showed up on top. it has a lot of great reviews. i decided i was sold and called them.  i received an appointment the same day. this wonderful gentleman came by and knew right  away the issue and fixed it lickety split. so awesome. fast, efficient, friendly and reasonable!! can't beat it!!! great job!!"
3688,"kelly was amazing. when i called to get an estimate for mold testing/remediation from a roof leak, he offered to come to my house the same day. he and his crew were able to start repairs quickly, which was important since i was planning to go on a long vacation and i wanted the repairs completed before i left. the pricing was more than reasonable and his crew showed up on time or early each day. we had a small hiccup on day one, but kelly more than made up for it with his responsiveness and willingness to go above and beyond. after repairs were completed and a mold test conducted, we found out the mold spore count outside my house was really high. kelly offered to do additional fogging and take other measures in my house, including replacing the air filter, all of which he did for no extra charge. now i can go on vacation without having to worry about the mold in my house. thanks for everything, kelly!"
3689,"free is free!

for most men in vegas it might be their only chance to experience an eruption or two for the nigtht if you catch my drift - unless they get lucky or even head to lover's ranch - lol. 

with the era of free attractions in vegas long gone, it's nice to know that the volcano is alive and well unlike the free tram from treasure island to the mirage.  it is always down for repair, with nobody working on it.

this attraction gets busy fast - so be sure to arrive early to secure a prime view.  if you get close enough you'll feel the heat and the drum beat vibrate your body.

always worth the price of admission.  

a must see when visiting vegas and the world famous strip."
3690,"these guys were timely and professional. dave and his associate came out to inspect an issue with my water heater. they determined that the pilot control was faulty. they researched my equipment and found that the equipment was still in warranty and contacted the original installer of my water heater. 

these guys took the time to give me the information and help me setup repair work with the company that was responsible for the equipment. even though they did not do the actual work to be paid, they were extremely helpful in getting me to the right source. i will definitely use them for all my future plumbing needs."
3691,"eric is fantastic! he responded within an hour on the day before thanksgiving, and came out same day. it was a simple repair and he only charged us a reasonable trip charge. personable, trustworthy and competent. highly recommend."

3697,"i had my garage door go out on me and jt stone at precision garage door was very helpful in explaining all the components that make up garage door assembly and what all our options were to make necessary repairs.  after selecting the repairs we wanted, he was very fast and efficient in making said repairs.  he was very polite and complete professional.  i have and will continue to go to precision garage door company for all my garage door needs because of professionals like jt.

thank you,"
3698,"got takeout from the side entrance of the restaurant a few times and they give very big portions of chips and a great crispy halibut.

3702,"luis is one special man. when he opened the vent below my fairly new air handler he found a leak, and a defect in the installation. he was all ready to repair it when we decided that this could cause a problem with the warranty. so he treated the mold and took video explaining what he found. he cleaned my vent and spent a lot of time dealing with it all. i give him 5 stars because he was very kind and went above the call of duty. thank you luis!"
3703,"pro diesel did some repairs for me on one of my company trucks. i feel like they gave me a fair price and had the work done in a reasonable amount of time. if you need repairs done, i'd recommend trying this company."
3704,"i am always so impressed by the team at esprit decor, not just for the outstanding work they have done for some very treasured works of art, but for how lovely they are every time i do business with them. and they always go above and beyond. just today, i brought in a print with matting that i had purchased abroad, and the size was in metric standard, so i was challenged with finding a frame to fit. when i brought the print in, rather then steer me toward a custom frame (which i was more than willing to pay for), the owner suggested they trim the print and matting to fit a frame i had already purchased so i could save money. and then refused to take any payment for doing so. they have also repaired hardware on my prints in the past without charging me. i will never take my cherished art and photographs anywhere else. they are simply the best!"
3705,we hired liberty to inspect a home we recently purchased and they found items that saved me at least 2 thousand dollars in repairs. thanks for the great inspection nick
3706,had a great experience with mike!  totally honest & fair!  came on time and was thorough in his evaluation. definitely will be calling them again for any future repairs!
3707,"wayne newton 
he can't sing anymore and nobody told him. he looks old and surgically repaired. he tells the same viagara jokes from 20 years ago. the show is hokey, and corny. it doesn't matter because it doesn't get any better than this. in las vegas at caesars palace on the barge, martini in hand and wayne freaking newton on stage 10 feet away. see this before it goes away and becomes a fond distant memory."
3708,"another fast, efficient repair from deke's.  thanks again so much for getting out today.  it was probably one of their busiest days, since the weather turned cold and everyone turned on their heat.  we can't say enough about how good this company is.  they are very fair in pricing, always are reliable, and never try to sell you something you don't need.  we highly recommend them, and thanks again to darren for fitting us in today.  you folks are the best!"
3709,"unfortunately my disposal needed replacing so i called plumbing masters. since it was my first time using them they also checked all of the draining for my bathtubs, my water heater and the psi for my water. mark was friendly, courteous and was able to install not just a new disposal but also a new safety valve since my water pressure was too high. 
i really like that they go by the book for repairs and not charge per hour like a lot of other plumbers do. will definitely call them again in the future!!"
3710,marty is a hard working and a knowledgeable repairman. thank you for fixing our dryer.
3711,"mike came highly recommended and did a fantastic job on my kitchen renovation. as a new homeowner i wasn't sure what kind of electrical outlets and lighting i needed for my new kitchen. mike looked at the floor plan and provided a wealth of excellent recommendations. i will be calling him again for my next home project.

thanks mike. the kitchen looks fantastic!

roy"
3712,"our furnace wasn't working. they came next morning, diagnosed the problem and replaced the thermostat. everything works fine now. repairman was polite and professional."
3713,these guys do an amazing job! i've worked with them a few times to repair damage to various furniture and it's always been a pleasure working with them. i highly recommend working with the village woodsmith. :)
3714,"chris is highly professional and extremely knowledgeable.  he has years of prior experience building and maintaining homes, and it shows in his work.  i had both a plumbing and electrical issue.  he was able to resolve both in a reasonable time frame, and even took the time to educate me about what was wrong and how i could fix an issue i had by myself in the future.  i recommend priority one home repair without hesitation to anyone looking for a quality job done right."
3715,"best cycle place around.  super knowledgeable staff,  great selection and accessories'.   always helpful with tweaks, upgrades and repairs"
3716,"i was looking a total shower replacement after the pan cracked. i had several other companies out to look at it and everyone of them was giving estimates in the thousands. all of them wanted to demo the shower and then install a whole new shower. one guy even wanted to demo and then just replace the pan, without arranging to replace tiles. i called like-nu and they were to look at it and told that they didn't have to pull anything. while they were in the process of the repair they did see that there was no support for the shower at all and were able to correct that for a fairly low cost as well. 
once they were done they were even able to refinish the pan so it looks new also. 
these guys do terrific work and they aren't trying to charge you an arm and a leg for it either!"
3717,"mike and his crew have been an invaluable asset in helping us rehab our first rental property. not only do they do great work, they're also extremely reliable and efficient. mike is an upstanding guy and very fair and honest. we'll definitely call mike in the future for further repairs and have already referred him to other homeowners!"
3718,"absolutely fantastic experience! brian came out to analyze my old water softener and frankly just educate me as i knew absolutely nothing about the system. i expected the unit to need several repairs but brian was able to recommend affordable options for me and explain the best, most cost efficient route for my water softener needs. they absolutely earn the name integrity and i look forward to seeing them in the future for all my water softener and water filtration needs."
3719,"thank you marco for fixing our heater! another repair company dropped the ball, after our warranty company called them. the warranty company called air squad yesterday and they set an appointment for today. i was given a window from 11-2pm (on a saturday). i received a call from marco at approximately 10:45, saying he was on his way, and arrived shortly after."
3720,"overall, my experience with this company was satisfactory and positive. i had pipe repairs done recently. the plumbers had to jackhammer the tile floor in my kitchen and cut into the patio to access the pipes. of course, this meant that i needed another repair! i contacted several concrete contractors. only two of them responded. and only saguaro offered to drop by my house for an estimate. steve told me that normally it would take 8 weeks to get an appointment-but he graciously offered to schedule it sooner so that i wouldn't have to live with a massive hole in my kitchen floor. thankfully, it was a small job. both he and vanessa were kind and professional. i would hire saguaro again. hopefully, i won't need to do so."
3721,"guys were great realistic time frames,  and ensured any repairs needed were brought to the forefront. still they were quick friendly and was able to use their charging station while i waited."
3722,"very satisfied with this company.  scheduling with sandy was a breeze.  handyman richard arrived precisely at 0800.  very professional, friendly, skilled and efficient.  we will definitely return to this company for future projects."
3723,"needed a headlight replaced asap. 


went to firestone earlier that day & was quoted $105! immediately walked out & did some more research. found rex body & fender repair! spoke with jeff- told me to come on in at a certain time, the same day! fifteen minutes later & my headlight was replaced for a fraction of the cost! super cool guy! highly, highly, highly recommend this place!"
3724,i contacted stellar through the yelp app and they were very responsive.  i was looking for some weatherstripping for my garage that had been damaged and had previously had 2 other companies come out to look at it for repair.  i never heard a peep from those other companies again which i never understood.  stellar came out and had the work done in under an hour.  i will definitely be using them in the future for any of my garage door problems.
3725,"i rented a house by former colony america now waypoint. i have called them for maintenance issues and each time someone has responded either the same day or within 24 hours. yes there have been 2 occasions where estimates for repairs were needed, but they never missed an appt and repairs completed within 5 days. air conditioning done the same day. worked with waypoint agent jan torres to find a second rental. the advantage in working with their agent is you can see vacant homes promptly before they can be seen by outside agents. then i worked with jenneal bell through the rental process. very professional and assisted me in getting the closing rental cost for my present rental so no extra monies were taken out.  would recommend this company."

3727,"steve from maintenance did a fantastic job getting our faucet replaced.  he showed up well within the time frame i had chosen for maintenance, was pleasant and professional, and we now have water in the kitchen sink again.  he came to the house, established it could not be repaired (must be replaced), took a quick trip to home depot then returned and finished the work.  it was a fairly quick and simple process from submission of work order through completion of work.  thank you, steve!"
