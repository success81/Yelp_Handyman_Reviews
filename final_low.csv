0,show up with no supplies to do the work!!. they start at 8am leave at 10:45 and don't re turn till 4:40. they never stay more than 4 hours a simple repair that would take 4 days is into 3 weeks. i called the boss he can't manage his people at all.
1,"i had new cabinet vanity and faucet installed from this company 2 months ago, it totally messed up, it always leaking in different spots, have to ask lowes plumber re-install everything again, they said this ""call 4 handyman"" didn't installed the right way, for sure this company is sucks, unprofessional, they do ugly work! hope they stop running the business soon!"
2,"wanted to use my groupon, and they were closed for renovation! not sure how long that will last, but you may want to call first if you are thinking of going soon. will update when i can actually go!"
3,"usually i love this salon, but i got the worst pedicure yesterday. the shellac has already come off my big toe, my cuticles hurt from her scraping the polish off as she painted. she almost forgot a top coat, so shaky....so disappointing. they are in the middle of a renovation and there is dust everywhere. not enjoyable."
4,i took my richo wide lense camera in for repair in 2000 when i lived in canada. the staff kept my camera for themselves and refused to return it after i wrongfully assumed they would repair it for a fee. it was in the markham town centre. i just think they are thieves and opportunists with no sales talent. they prey on the weak and vulnerable just like any other predator. thumbs down to all of them...
5,"i hired them to find a leak. they guaranteed their work. marked an x on the spot where the leak was, 100% guarantee no way. i hired a contractor to dig where they marked. 10 feet away they found the leak. this cost me over $2000 extra for my contractor to dig in the wrong place and to repair damaged stone work.  i called them up and they said they dont guarantee location at all. but when they were here they guaranteed this 100%. they made me sign a contract after they found the location which said they are not responsible for anything. i did not read the fine print. this company is unethical.  they also broke several parts in my hot tub where the jets are. they said this was necessary because it was the only way they could find the leak.. 

just a horrible experience from a company that totally mislead me. lots of other companies out there. do not deal with this one.."
6,awful company!!! do not use!!! they came out to my house to repair my month old dryer under warranty and ended up breaking another piece. they also ordered the wrong part which took a month and 3 visits to fix. then when i questioned them they said that they didn't do it and that i needed to submit another warranty claim. i think this was just their way of getting more money out of samsung.
7,"outdated, years of disgusting smell as if it's never been replaced nor cleaned, just very unpleasant!

yes i understand it's a gym and it's suppose to smell like sweat.. yes i understand it's one of the oldest lvacs... but the place needs some serious renovations! 

i will forever be faithful to the lvac on eastern/215.. no matter how close this one is!"
8,"this review is rated pg13 for adult language 

fuck this piece of shit company!  i hate that i had to give them one star.  so on a sunday we turned off the water valve in the garage because we were working on the kitchen sink.  something snapped when it was being shut off and the water supply in our home stopped working.  we called our warranty and they told us this company would call us to schedule an appointment within 24 hours (i guess running water isn't an emergency). 

so today javier from air pro shows up 15 minutes before our scheduled time (thankfully i had just got home) and had attitude before he even stepped into the garage.  i can say with 100% certainty this asshole had his mind made up before he arrived that he wasn't doing the repair.  i offered him water and started to explain the problem when he very shortly and rudely said he would put in the report to the warranty that he didn't see how the valve broke and didn't have the parts to do the repair on him. what?!?  you're a fn plumber! isn't that what you do daily?!  plus, when we put in the claim we explained exactly what happened - wouldn't you want to come prepared?! and also, asshole, you don't know how it broke?!?! how about that valve is probably turned once every 4 years and maybe, juuuussst maybe, it is corroded and rusted, causing it to break??? i'll just leave that suggestion right there for you to play with next time you encounter this problem, you plumbing genius. 

now to the best part - this unprofessional, unbelievably rude, lazy employee writes in his report to our home warranty that the valve was broke because of excessive force causing them to deny the claim.  really?!?!  it was simply turned off!!  then they had the balls to call us and say they will fix it for $900 (another company quoted $320).  

thankfully our warranty agreed that his report sounded inaccurate and they're sending another company to look at it. 

do not use this shit excuse of a company!!!! javier is the worst excuse of a lazy incompetent ""professional"" i've ever dealt with. 

that being said i shall now go wash my fingers in bleach."
9,"my last review of this place was in 2011; it's now 2015.
since then,i don't think anything has been painted, repaired or up-graded.

c'mon, break out a paint roller, dust off a shelf, maintain the equipment.
this place is filthy, dank and nasty.  it's like training in a petri dish."
10,"these people are liers, cost me $$$ in repair bills for my rental.  
i would not recommend them to anyone... 
beware....     they kept my rent and other monies. 
they have very bad accounting skills."
11,"the new renovation only helps out the trainers, they roped off a section that everyone was used to using and continue to kick people off when no one is using it. i just witness one of the trainers kick a girl off, then continue to talk to the person he is training about her, how professional is that. just another reason why no one pays these useless trainers to get trained. just another reason why la sucks."
12,"called them to have 2 windows repaired. they scheduled for 12:00 didn't show at that time, said they would arrive until 2:00, we wait longer. we call , the young girl was very unprofessional and kept making excuses stating that gas was expensive etc ? what does that have to do with showing up ? i asked if they were with the bbb, she replied no. i spent my whole day waiting and decided so far they are unreliable, i cancelled and had it done it 1 hour. very rude, unprofessional."
13,the owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it.
14,i paid for an estimate ($99) from this company and was told that it would be $774 for the repairs to my lg front load washer. plus they wanted me to pay them in cash after taking a check for the estimate. i chose not to work with them on this repair because i felt that they may not be around to warranty their repairs. i then had someone from lg come out and the same repairs were $324 instead of $774. buyer beware...
15,"awful awful awful. wonder how it's still in business. had our equipment for weeks without a repair and poor communication, not returning calls,etc. they said one week max and my husband picked it up four weeks later in the exact same condition. do not waste your time!"
16,"they advertise they fix the galaxy s6 active on their website but this place turned me away saying they would even attempt it repair it.

they refer you to your ""warranty"".  if i had a warranty i wouldn't be here! 

the guy was polite enough but don't say you fix the s6 active on your website when you don't."
17,this is a poor attempt to save face.   but i can post a signed document from the named executor that will prove that we were up sold for your profit and to take advantage of a family with a limited budget.  disappointed.   i can also add that you failed to have the dvds available and operational for the church at the viewing.  these mistakes are unrepairable.  you only get to have a funeral once.   instead of trying to save face.  try apologizing or reimbursing the family for one of many huge mistakes.
18,"manager had bad communication and was unprofessional.  we were told we earned our deposit and house looked amazing at walk-through...then got call a week later that the owner wanted repairs done for $150.  we were told to ""get a lawyer' after expressing our frustration.  we were told we were amazing renters...well  you just lost us due to your unprofessionalism."
19,pretty bad. my faucet was leaking and after 4 plumbers it is still leaking. they have done several repairs but none of them seem to work.
20,installers aren't as well versed as they think they are on the modern technology they are selling.  i had a horrifying experience with this company and ended up with no air conditioning for 7 hours.  an emergency 24/7 professional had to come out and repair what prolink messed up.  do yourself a favor and don't open the door if they come calling.
21,"went there today only to find a big sign on the door that says ""closed for renovations"" which is never a good thing in my experience.  sign says ""maybe we'll open by wednesday"" but of course which wednesday is not specified.  noted that several other people were coming to the door and being disappointed.  too many dim sum places closing--not a great trend.  hope this is truly just for renovations."
22,have to take these guys to court....is giving them a zero star an option?  i have been without ac in half my house for a month and a half.  it took sending out 4 of their own guys to come to the conclusion that they would pay no more than $ 500 for a $3500 repair...and that was after i had to get two outside opinions on my own dime and provide 2 years of maintenence proof.  even after all that was done...they continue to be rude and unethical....even though i have a recording of robert telling my fiance the unit would be covered in full where anthony and kevin said nothing will be covered....expect a slap in the face $500.
23,this is the worst idea ever. the bus tool forever because it kept stalling and we had to stop on the strip and everywhere else. i never did this shuttle before and i never will. not worth the ten dollars you save one way. i almost got out and walked if it wasn't for the two suitcases. bus 2058 needs repairs.
24,"this was one of the worst experiences of my life.  trusted that this company would look after my property and after paying them 10% of my rent received for years.  the property was returned to me with thousands of dollars in repairs needed and after speaking to a friend in law enforcement they told me that all signs led them to believe that there had been a  ""grow room"" in my downstairs bedroom (the vents were tampered with, electrical was pulled from the wall and all paint had been stripped from the walls)

when asked about the damages i was told ""we can't live with them"".  i asked how they could miss all the damage !!!  don't make the mistake of trusting this company .... you'll be sorry !!!"
25,"i honestly have to say this place is a mess. i enjoyed the comedians but i was so uncomfortable. my seat was very lumpy. the place was very dirty. the ladies room was equally dirty so i held it until i got home. i think it needs some renovations. 

i didn't like that our parking voucher said $5 and they made us pay $10. the show was to start at 8:30 it started at 9p and the 15 minute intermission turned into 30 minutes. the show was suppose to be an hour and half but it ended up being 3 hours.

i did like that every seat appears to be a good seat."
26,"this place has been around about 7 years and it lost whatever cool factor it had about 2 years in, has had no updates our renovations unlike other locations in its chain

the concept didn't make sense that it's a ""county party bar"" that lies about being country as they always play top 40."
27,"so this would be the 3rd time we have used this company, 1st the repair guys are not good with ladies, dis-respectful in how the talk and respect ladies. i could not be home when frank (?) came. i had my wife call me and he was short with me and rude to my wife. 

we will never used them again"
28,"$225.00, elevators take forever, bathroom floor was wet when we got in, paint coming off the doors, rust, shower curtain attacks you while taking a shower, ac is noisy, pillows are small, don't think they've spent any money on renovations on the room we were in in quite a while. first and last time at the flamingo!"
29,"finally showed up and did a good job on the repair.  $300.00, an hour late on easter sunday morning.  did not earn my future business."
30,"after telling me on two separate days that he would come over to perform some rather simple woodworking repairs and then failing to show, he told me he would be over at the beginning of the following week.  when i contacted him at the beginning of the week, he then said that he had just been hired for a large job and would not be available for over two weeks. very unprofessional to lie to clients and cause them further delays when you choose to take on a new job before attending to jobs that you had already been hired for."
31,"i called valley wide on the word of a good friend. i called to set up an estimate to repair our master bath. the estimator came out on 2/3/16 and said he'd get the quote to us shortly. on 2/8 i received an email that i'd have my quote later that day or the next. after sending a follow up email, i finally received that estimate on 2/16/16. i emailed him that same day letting him know we decided to do a different material for the shower. on 2/17, he thanked me for the email and said he'd get that updated quote to me as soon as possible....today is match 1 st and i've yet to receive that updated quote. it seems that our business was perhaps not wanted. that's the only reason i can think of for taking such a long time to get a customer a quote, maybe hoping that we'd go with a different company. well, it worked."
32,"this seemingly fun place that is hampered by a completely inept staff and a bunch of games in various states of disrepair.

i could've gotten over the staff being crappy if i could just play games that actually worked. i'll just go to the pinball hall of fame to satisfy my nerdy urges properly."
33,"too much equipment ""out of order"" and not repaired quick enough. almost every time i come in a different piece of equipment is broken down. i think their repair crew quit on them. might also be the meat heads slamming the weights too hard for attention. smh."
34,"you were closed for ""repairs"" but what you should fix is my broken heart. i am usually excited for the kk lights, but only darkness, sadness and shame."
35,"same thing happened to me from the above comment.
ended up spending more than 3,000 dollars in repairs. i would not recommend this place to anyone. i am writing a complaint to the dmv to help resolve the matter."
36,"i was charged twice for sprinkler repairs , over $200.  i pointed out i still had issues, he said he didn't know why it still was leaking & that he could not do anything else. i called a real sprinkler company out, & they had to redo some of his mess up & a valve that he replaced is no good!"
37,"warning restaurant is closed because it's  under construction as of march 2018

brought my family there after driving for 30mins sadly it's not listed anywhere that the restaurant is under renovation thus it is closed"
38,"great meal, but just not worth it.
too expensive, too loud, and very outdated.
there are just too many great restaurants around to make this place worthwhile.  
the interior is well past needing a major renovation. drab and even a little dirty feeling."
39,"it's a shame that the chain that really started the specialty coffee explosion has come to this.

push button instant espressos, and waaay too much milk, which may not even be hot..   the baristas are too busy and things don't look sanitary behind the counter.  the lineups at this location are simply not manageable in the mornings.

i still buy ground coffee here, but will only buy prepared coffee if i am absolutely desperate, and that hasn't happened in quite a while.

the recent renovation hasn't helped anything, although more people can probably sit down and hang out, if that's your thing, i go for the coffee."
40,i just went in there to get a couple of windows repaired and was told it would take 2 days and i needed a copy of my receipt. what kind of business won't look at the original receipt. i talked to chris . and was very rude .
41,the genius bar people are very friendly but the repair department is awful. they have a serious problem here. sherway gardens is much better. i'll stick with them from now on.
42,i was in the area so i tried out royal cleaners. a bit pricey i think.....the 2 out of 3 pairs of shorts i had them repair (buttons) have came off again. being that they weren't cheap i expected a much better job
43,this place is old. and it seems it. despite some major renovations i'd actually say this hilton is lower-end then your average hilton around the country. everything was clean and the cost is reasonable but i wouldn't come here again (thankfully this was a biz trip and i didn't pay for my stay). there's not much around here within walking distance which is really a big bummer in vegas. one redeeming quality is that it has its own monorail stop.
44,"this company is a joke. overcharging for simple repairs, said it would take 3 weeks to get a refrigerator water line. unacceptable. made a call to ge who fixed it in 10 minutes with no surprise charges. i'm thinking that buy rite has a contract with protective plan we got thru hoa. canceled the protective plan as well."
45,"if you want to have attitude from the guy that come to your house... call these guys 

he was more worried about who was gonna pay for the repairs than doing them. i live in a rental so i shouldn't be the one to make the decisions and pay for it.

overall bad experience go with a different company"
46,i worked with dave on a finding a house. i was pre approved and ready to go. i went with dave because i went to upnest and he gave up 40 percent of his commission to go towards closing. he was available and eager to help me. most of my experience was good until i found a house. he isn't aggressive really at all. he kinda plays middle man and dosent look out for his clients best interest. i went over asking and thought i could make it up in the seller credits. dave hooked me up with his handyman he he used for years and was great. he extremely low balled the repairs and basically hooked me up with his guy who obviously has seen better days. i never met him personally i trusted dave to get the quote take it to the seller and get the credits. unfortunately his guy has no idea what he's doing. the repairs he quoted will cost 3 times what i got in seller credits. he basically gave me a fictional quote. his guy went mia and they both left me high and dry after the closing. now i'm paying someone 3 times to do it the right way. the sad part is the seller was willing to pay for it to be done right. when i asked him why he would do this to a client he seems to only deal with people who are unreliable. i guess i'm his world that's what it is. i guess if you got to give up half your commission to get business you got bigger problems.
47,"i couldn't leave no stars that's the only reason they are getting 1. they never keep they're appointment times, they never call with a different appointment time you have to call them, and they just don't show up for scheduled appointments. hands down one of the worst companies i've had to deal with in regards to home repairs. it's dumbfounding how they can even stay open with the way they treat their customers. don't waste your time and money with this company."
48,they are just ok they do not repair things when asked they just raised rent to 900 many things that county should be made aware of.
49,"just came home from work early and waited an hour and a half for an appointment scheduled a week ahead of time for repair work on my yard irrigation. they not only didn't show up, they didn't call to let me know they wouldn't be coming or to reschedule. i would definitely not recommend this company to anyone, and i will not make the mistake of calling them to reschedule. fool me once, shame on me..."
50,"beware:  right guys caused thousands of dollars worth of water damage to my home.  my warranty company assigned them to replace the angle stops in my bathrooms and kitchen.  they kept popping out.  they were plastic and the plumber told me they are not used any more.  the plumbers  incompetence caused a leak in my upstairs bathroom behind the wall that caused water to come through my kitchen ceiling. they had brandon come and fix the leak the next day.  he explained to me what the previous plumber had done wrong, apologized and assured me they would repair the damage. they sent a restoration company out to assess the damage then lied to the warranty company to get them to cover the cost of fixing it.  now he says i had a leak before they came out.  i would give right guys negative stars if i could.  look at his responses to unhappy customers. it speaks volumes."
51,shamrock roofing company is a sham. beware of estimates and work done by them. they came out to inspect a roof on a house in mesa for a realtor who is the listing agent and did not see the water damage under the eves or in the bedrooms. three other reputable roofing companies all caught the water damage and gave a fair estimate for repairs. shamrock roofing on the other hand was going to silicone the cracked and broken tiles and did not inspect the under lament. i give this roofing company two thumbs down and a dumpster!
52,"i've been trying to get a handyman through the app for some simple work around my house for weeks and have just had five cancellations in a row. it's like clockwork, one hour before my booking is supposed to start the app says there was a ""last-minute pro call-off"" and that they have to reschedule. 

i've complained but they have not refunded my money, they only give me credit in the app, in other words they're keeping my money and the work i've paid for isn't getting done. 

it's very clear to me that handy is lying to consumers, saying a booking has been made and not making a booking at all. 

avoid this app like the plague."
53,"run far far away. the place is worn down. managed by people who couldn't find their way out of a wet paper bag. 
their ""maintenance"" personnel must have learned their repair knowledge from a joke in a cracker jax box. 
never ever ever rent here."
54,horrible repairs that did more damage to my windows (than when they 1st got here). like a nightmare having them in my home! man talk about inept! absolutely no professional abilities with these guys!
55,they did a great job with the repair. my complaint is that one of the parts failed after 3 months and they said it was due to road debris when there was no apparent damage to the part.
56,highly recommended avoiding a kb home at all cost. they hire low quality contractors to do shotty work. they are the worst to work with gettin issues fixed. i have had my floor repaired numerous times and now have to have the whole thing replaced! and it was not the original floor picked at the studio. don't waste your money go with a different builder!!!
57,"i signed up just to post this review.
avoid at all costs!

i did some business with them to produce a design a renovation.  they ignored my design, did a horrible and an incomplete job and on top of that they refused to complete it. they currently being sued for their shady business practices."
58,ama also does plumbing and they are contracted with my home warranty company.  i have a $1000 limit with my home warranty for the slab leak repair.  ama gave me a quote of $7000 and i just had another company out that will repair it for $1300.
59,"horrible!! in september 2013, we took my daughter's yamaha trumpet in for a minor repair. in january, they still had not repaired it. in february, when we returned again not only had it not been repaired, they had somehow caved in one of the valves. they did not charge us, but in no way did they offer to try to make it better or even apologize for the additional damage they did. a completely shameful way to do business. customer beware."
60,"my fathers garage door broke and in need of repair .  a broom stick fell by the track and it broke.  we called for someone to give an estimate !! garage door for 3000$ !! really so what it has windows and insulated.   took total advantage of an elderly person.  
i called to advise them not to fix it after my elderly father told the repair guy to do it and they wanted to charge a restock fee and had a terrible attitude.  
for the same garage door the highest estimate we received after the fact was $1200.00
if you want to throw money away then use this company"
61,i used to liker this place until they did a few bad jobs on my pants and refused to repair
62,the repair had a issue where a clip wasn't replaced . then my seats were covered in grease !!!
63,horrible company just horrible burned up the new compressor they supposedly installed completely broke my brand new lg fridge and when i called to tell them about it the trailer trash of an owner got mad at me and hung up. sears came out and said my fridge was beyond repair the evaporator was bad they broke a line spraying freon all in my house and left it they are incompetent should not even be in business beware!
64,"worst company ever! we made the mistake of renting through this joke of a company for 2 years and will never again make that same mistake or ever allow our friends or family to either! they do not respond to calls, they take their time with repairs. we had to go as far as finding out who the owner of the home was ans call him!!!!! don't  waste you time, energy, or money!"
65,"ordered online. delivered sectional couch and recliner as scheduled. installers didn't completely connect all pieces of the sectional, discovered one of the reclining parts of the sectional wouldn't put the feet up, then a person was sent out to repair it and broke it further, now leaving it permanently open. waited a week for them to get in touch with us. they say they're going to give a replacement but not until after christmas. so we have a permanently opened reclining part of a sectional open all the time. very unsatisfactory. will not buy from there again."
66,"have been looking for a good handyman for sometime and unfortunately, i'll have to keep looking. we needed three new sinks installed and mr. fix it was not happy that there were other trades working in the house, mad that he'd have to get some supplies, and unwilling to work past four. besides, he was rude to my girlfriend. i fired them and am getting someone else."
67,"if i could give zero stars i would. i've had track homes, custom homes, spec homes, built from the ground up and lennar is by far the absolute worst home builder known to man. we bought in olympia ridge and i will say lennar has no business building high-end homes. what a joke. they're in lawsuits with majority of the homeowners, forced another homeowner to move from their brand new home and put it on the market and the list goes on. they hire cheap workers, cheap trades and low budget on everything. i can honestly say i've been inside the homes of 8 eight homeowners (out of 35) and every single home was covered in blue tape waiting on a lennar repairs. so sad. the fixtures, lighting, and home warranty is an absolute joke. the fixtures are the same as the fixtures they put in a 200k home and they put them in a 2mm home. such a joke. lennar, you need to stop building and move on. you are definitely not in the niche for home building."
68,"liars. they took over the property we were renting when the owner sold it. we had all kinds of problems with things breaking from the time we moved in. when we moved out, there were things that needed replacing and updates because of plumbing problems and pipes leaking. it was hard to get them to fix anything without an argument. the plumber that fixed the leaky pipe told us the whole system needed to be ripped out and replaced.  now these people are giving us bad references, saying that we left the place in bad shape. they kept our deposit. we cleaned and scrubbed everything from top to bottom before we left. even made a few repairs ourselves. i wouldn't recommend renting from them ever."
69,"initially they came out and did the repair as needed for 250+ dollars.  said i had a 2 year warranty.  however, after door stopped rolling again we contacted and no one very returned our call, contacted a 2nd time, and then waited all summer with a broken door.  finally got another company to come and fix for us."
70,"do not do business here!  classic bait and switch plus false advertising!  ""best warranty in arizona - 3 years or 36,000 miles for all rebuilt and repaired transmissions"" - right?...sure, ok... that they do not honor.  paid for a rebuilt transmission 10 months ago, and it went to s*** after 10 short months, and they refused to honor the warranty that is on their website.  do not waste your money.  utter incompetence.  i'm betting all the positive reviews are fake."
71,had them come out on january 11th 2019 for a leak in the laundry room. they charged me $300 to supposedly fix the leak. it did not fix the leak and called another company who found the leak in another area and informed me what they did in my laundry to fix the supposed leak was wrong and against code. i paid another plumber to fix the problem and repair what they did wrong. amazing leak referred me to a dry way repair guy also who flaked so nothing good for me to report on amazing leak detection and i will not call them again.
72,"i got these guys through my fidelity home warranty and they're horrible! i tried to file a claim on an item that wasn't covered.  (not their fault)  i then asked them if they did the work that they apply my deductible payable to them to the repair.  they said that they would, but then charged me both.  when i tried to call them out on it, they said that their tech would never say that.  i tried to reason with them by explianing that i still paid them what anyone else would if they had the work done through them plus the deductible, but they were obstinate and wouldn't listen.  if you get to these guys through fidelity, i'd strongly recoomend that you go somehwere else.  not cool at all!"
73,"after reading the reviews i decided to hire 24/7 electrical to repair my kitchen pendant lights that were malfunctioning.  i was charged $150 for ""jiggling"" a couple of the light strands and told my problems were ""fixed"".  there was one light that still did not work - they couldn't fix it so they just took it down.  then they sent me all over town looking for a part to properly fix that light, which to this day i still cannot find.  after a month a couple of the lights stopped working, so i called them out for yet another repair and after one changed bulb, one light still did not work, and was charged another $75.

after $225 and two appointments i expected a more thorough diagnosis of the issues with my pendants lights - and i also expect that if a light needs a part in order to operate properly, that my electrician would find the part and re-install the pendant lights the way they were designed to be.

i have had other projects that required electrical work and found better, more thorough  technicians than what i experienced at 24/7."
74,"called to get a quote, instead got a lecture about how i do not know anything. he said that i will never find anyone else in the city that can repair miele better than him. completely unprofessional. then, he had the audacity to hang up on me mid-sentence. i am appalled."
75,called to schedule  repair done on gutters they installed several years ago.  to date no return call.  went with someone else...bought larger gutters as the ones they installed too small for my roof size.  you snooze you loose.  i do not recommend this company.
76,"if there was a way to rate this company a zero i would! the owner operator was extremely rude, used abusive language and hung up on us while trying to discuss our repairs! i would file a complaint with the bbb but this business is not accredited by them. not hard to figure out why!!"
77,had repairs done last year for over 3000. now my unit is dead and they say another 4000! stay away.
78,we buried our grandmother there in 1972 and for a while resthaven was maintained.  it didn't take very long for the cemetery to go downhill.  flowers have been removed when told they would not. two of our family's gravestones were chipped by mowers. one gravestone had the flower pot bent - again by a mower. this was never repaired.  too many times my family has had to deal with issues.  absolutely cannot recommend this cemetery. we found this disgusting site at 11:15 am on father's day!
79,"worst company we ever work with. so-called report doesn't have at the end  list of problems / issues what need to be repaired in the house- you have to look for them in plain text thru the whole report, and half of  them doesn't have good explanation , just referred to the pictures, which have same numbers so it's impossible to figure out which picture describes what  kind of problem. when client  asked in email to fix the report so him or me or my assistant or our agent could understand it, client  got called insulted. very dissapointing experience."
80,"two days after ""fixing"" my heater, it stopped working.  i made an appointment to have it repaired which they confirmed but then canceled because they said they had other customers who had called after me they needed to attend to first.  then i made yet another appointment, and i ended up waiting 5 hours for them."
81,"tried going tonight, but closed -- at 8pm on a weeknight!not good if you're in the restaurant business.  general manager needs to keep an eye on repairs and maintenance  -- most of their outdoor electric sign is burned out (and has been for at least a year), and booths inside are looking pretty worn out."
82,"dan, the owner is not very friendly.  he is rude and very condescending. i bought a washer and dryer from them and they turned out to be a fix and repair nightmare.  i am starting to think they sell reconditioned merchandise."
83,"love how the first rating is from the guy that owns the company. worked for over 6mo with these guys with very little result. a few minor things removed, but nothing anywhere near credit repair."
84,"seriously agree...if i could give zero stars, i would!
the 4 hour window i was given was between 10 & 2. it is now 5:20 & i haven't heard a word! 
i called them at 2:45 because i needed to pick up my grandson & i was informed that the repairman was a ""bit""  behind schedule and there was still one call ahead of me...therefore, i had plenty of time to ick up the ""kid"" or i could reschedule. reschedule!!!???? and waste another whole day???
seriously? common courtesy would have him making a call to let those of us (waiting at home) that he was behind! 
if i had a choice, i would never use this company! thank you home warrant


no tony, you did not reach out to me! i had to call you to find out what was going on! get your facts straight! 
if you don't appreciate the poor reviews, consider reviewing your work. you act as if my time isn't important!"
85,"i called them out for a water main leak estimate. quoted 2 - 2.5 hrs for repair in labor and $100 in parts. total estimate $ 750!!!!! i guess they just wanted to collect my $49 fee to give a ridiculous estimate! almost $300 an hour to dig a hole and cut out and replace a pipe??? not to mention, the tech thought he was a comedian. not funny! thanks for wasting my time and money guys!

just received another estimate for $225. that's more like it."
86,"i waited over a week for them to repair our microwave. when i called to find out the status (don't you think they should have called me??) he said could be a couple weeks for the part. i asked if he even knew where the part was and he yelled at me something like ""you don't know"" and hung up on me! 
they should not be in business!!"
87,"sadly, café la gaffe as we knew it no longer exists.  they made some quick, shoddy renovations in april 2019 that completely destroyed the atmosphere.  the bar that anchored the place has disappeared, replaced by very ugly fake wood wall panelling.  the floor is now plastic fake wood as well.  there are more tables than before, but the charm that made this place special is gone."
88,"this place is the worst place to get window repair or door fixed...there installer jc sucks at his job. they install the door but leave the locks and security sensors off. the old door had it on so the new door should have it on too. there over priced on there glass and door repair and make you wait over month for simple fix. north hill glass quoted us 2500 for repair and they quoted us 4,000 plus. worst place ever...do your self a favor and take your business anywhere but here. i recommend north hill glass..and there rude installer jc is rude and does poor job! not sure how this guy stays in business...save your money and don't call this glass company called quality glass just straight bad business‍‍‍"
89,this company charges ridiculous pricing for their work and they don't tell you what the amount is until they are done with the repairs.  make sure you confirm charges before work is done.
90,"came to fix the a/c in the summer. worked for a week, then it went down. waited a week for the second for the second attempt. they sent out the main guy this time. he got go it working. turned on the heater in the winter and now that is blowing cold air. it worked before a-1 repaired the a/c. they don't guarantee their work past 60 days."
91,"i really should give this place a n/a or zero star since they never bothered to show up for the appointment. we were given a two hour window and just waited and waited around. every other company we have contacted for a quote has managed to give us a specific time to expect them. shame, since there are so many good reviews that seemed promising for our full home renovation. but perhaps i should've known from the text message communication i received and the time window we were given (which i generally associate with cable companies, not a design firm) we weren't really dealing with true professionals."
92,"it's the ahs choice for home repair but i decided not to have it done since this business didn't understand what was an emergency situation. it want us to wait till next business day which is 3 days from today and my kitchen sink faucet was leaking hot water and needed attention asap.. finally it agreed but want us to pay $160.00 up front for taking away their family time besides the $75 deductible and the cost of the repair. lucky for us since my hubby has a little know how and fixed it. and also the number ahs gave us was not monitored since it was after 5pm friday. so i look up their other business and finally did make a contact. i don't recommend this business and ahs choice of company.
as to reply with air pro i just wanted it fixed i didn't mention about upgrade.i have relatives with children visiting the weekend about 8 people total and told me we can use cold water. unbelievable."
93,"terrible.
save yourself anger and headache later on.
go somewhere else !!

in fact, while i'm sitting here waiting for them to figure out how to help me with my banking, there is a repair person here getting instructions on fixing a door that the manager said was ""damaged by a customer that was mad at us when she left"".

i have a feeling things like this are getting to be a regular occurrence.
i will definitely be leaving this credit union very soon."
94,"had a water heater go out.  they showed up quickly to verify problem.  scheduled a repair.  no show, i called, rescheduled, no call - no show.  called again, same story different day.  3 weeks passed -rescheduled at least 6 times and never showed up.  had to hire someone else.  american home shield warranty covered problem.  guess business is to good to do warranty work.  cancelled ahs and won't do business with air pro master again (not that i really did business with them in the first place -as they never showed up after the initial visit)."
95,"terrible class schedule. there is classes at noon and then a huge break until 4 pm. for how expensive this membership is, it doesn't really include much. the schedule is garbage and i'm always having to drive to the dowd. now the dowd is having renovations and also closed their schedule for 4 hours. what a joke!!!!!!!!!!!"
96,horrible! my furniture is falling apart only 2 years after buying my living room set. the ottoman has already been repaired once and the cushions are ripping at the seams. i am very disappointed that i got rid of a sectional i had purchase from another company 15 years prior that was in better condition when i donated it than this 2 year old rooms to go sofa & love seat set.
97,"called these folks to come assess what was wrong with our ac. $79 later, i have a piece of paper that says to buy a new ac. no written explanation of anything, how to possibly repair, what the parts etc might cost. $79 down the drain; call someone else who will come do the estimate for free."
98,"this company did a great job installing basic gutters. they offered to install rain barrels, and that's where the problems started. barrels were damaged, because of improper installation, and gutters failed due to the faulty rain barrel install. after months, july to november, the company came to repair the gutters, remove damaged rain barrels, and wrote a check to cover the purchase of the new rain barrels.  gutters good, check bad. the owner, christian smallwood, gave many excuses, but never made good on the check. currently the issue is in the hands of the union county district attorney, due to the passing of a bad check, and i am hopeful that i will recoup the $500+ that this company cost me. caveat emptor, buyer beware!"
99,what a rude horrible business person. i don't know how he stays in business. i called about an oven repair and he was speaking i credibly rudely to me as i tried to explain the trouble i was having - basically yelling at me and insinuating i'm stupid. never in my life have i had an experience like this. stay clear!!!!!!!!
100,"a ahs warranty company that came out to repair my 20 year old dishwasher and told me i wasn't using it properly. i was told the model couldn't be read. i was told i should have kept a broken part. the gist of the visit was to deny repair to the dishwasher. 
when this company is assigned be prepared to protest to ahs and request a second opinion"
101,"if i could give them less stars, i would.  we have purchased two wonderful homes through lennar. the homes are outstanding.  lennar is less than fulfilling.  our agent michele zira made us so many promises and did not follow through.  now, on our second house in southern highlands, thinking it would be better, it is not.  still waiting, for 2 months, for things to be repaired on a brand new home.why is it so hard to get flaws on a new house to be fixed right away???"
102,"on 2/15/19, had pete repair a corner crack on concrete tile roof that was leaking. he used some black tar like material and said that it would last the life time of the tile. he was there 15 minutes and charged $125.00. i asked him to write on the receipt the guarantee that he talked about, but of course he wouldn't.  he said that if it leaked to call him and he would return.  several days later we had rain, snow and hail. the roof leaked in the exact same spot inside the house. i called and he returned my call that friday. he asked that i call on sunday morning to remind him. i called sunday morning and afternoon, no return call. i called on monday. no return call.  last call on tuesday, no return call.  talked guarantee, but no response.  paid $125.00 and roof still leaks."
103,"do not use this company! they will cheat you. they will deceive you. and they will do a horrible job. i live in an almost brand new house and the garage door stopped working. i called to have it repaired. without even looking at the garage door opener, i was told by the technician that it needed to be replaced (he must be a garage-door opener medium because he could read it without even seeing it). he said it would be $500. i told him i had a $100 coupon from his company's website. he told me he had already applied it. it would still be $500. the technician came out the next day and replaced the garage door opener with the same model i saw at home depot for less than $150. he was there less than 30 minutes and left a huge hole in my garage wall where the old garage door button used to be. now, i'm faced with another big expense to clean up this company's mess. i only wish i could leave this company zero stars. unprofessional! scammers! criminals! stay very far away from this company."
104,"don't use this company! i would have paid a little more for better quality workmanship than this company performed. after about three years a number of pavers started to pop up. when i called the company to ask if someone could come check it out, they said it would cost $350 just to come out to look at it and that would not even include the cost of the repair. very poor workmanship!!!!"
105,they told me i needed repairs worth over $800. they were wrong. when i told him they were wrong and why they were wrong they were a little resistance to a to admit it.
106,"i had used this plumber in the past and was happy. this visit, however consisted of several items. i should have gotten a quote prior to the repairs, but since he had been fair in the past i wasn't concerned. i was charged 480.00 for a small amount of work. this company charges a trip charge for each individual piece of work.  i won't be using them again."
107,just left and it is not there. probably under renovations. we visited yelp and the website prior to visit and no mention of renovation.
108,brought in my brand new lawn more because it stopped working. they couldn't find anything wrong with it but still charged me for the repair even though it is under warranty
109,"cautionary tale for others.  we contracted with rebath to remove a tub and build a walk in shower,  tile floor and walls.
the associate was professional and completed a wonderful looking shower.
unfortunately less than 4 years later the shower pan leaked causing damage to the first floor ceiling.  we contacted rebath to re-inspect it was determined the shower pan was the issue, not a plumbing issue.
*******the warranty claim was denied as they only warranty for 2 years****
the repairs required a complete tear out of the tile floor and walls to the studs.  upon removal it was determined the installer punctured the shower pan membrane.  he fastened with screws the membrane to the studs around the shower pan below the drain level, which corroded and allowed water to escape from the shower pan.
this information was then relayed to rebath with photos to show the pan was not built properly upon the installation.  no contact from the company to date.
review your contract, they warranty only 2 years, our bath remodel lasted less than 4."
110,"worst company we have ever done business with. melissa is
the worst. our air conditioning went out and needless to say 
they make every excuse to not pay or repair. we live in 
arizona and made no attempt to repair. made excuses and also 
lied to bbb.  dishwasher went out and it took 3 months to fix. our experiences are too horrific to explain. do not do business with this company!"
111,"drainpro caught on dateline nbc by chris hansen.  see the recent july 2011 episode where 3 representatives from drainpro try to get a lady to replace a perfect working water heater.  the rep even stated it can explode and electrocute her!

their repairman never owned up to it and he laughed at dateline's chris hansen."
112,"if i could give zero stars i would.  buyer beware of the warranty they will talk you into buying.  i need a repair done on my sofa and i've been trying to get them to come out for 6 months now and each time they are scheduled to come out it's either the part is missing or the contractor couldn't make it.  always an excuse.  if you try and call customer don't hold your breath on getting an answer instead expect the run around.  
go somewhere else to buy your furniture"
113,"horrible lost my boots! shame on them!
took three items for repair
1. boots needed resoul result very sloppy             workmanship
2. suede bag needed to be sowed. result poor glue job (i paid for sowing!) done instead.  a kid    could have done a better job
3. they lost my third pair of boots which needed heals.

their excuse was they are doing construction. 
which is bull$@!#
i asked to speak with the owner and the lady said he is in equator.
shame on them!"
114,"the good: the drivers are friendly and accommodating

the bad: the busses are in serious disrepair and dirty. the seats have recently been covered but the ceiling, walls, seat light/fan buttons were gnarly, the pull down shades were filthy. the seats were ridiculously uncomfortable - where you can feel the metal frame in your tailbone. the drivers were occasionally texting or taking pictures while driving - seriously."
115,the renovation of this place is horrible.  less games less play area so they can private seating for parties.  staff is semi friendly depends who you get.  wings and pizza were good.
116,"if i could give zero i would. i was sold a lemon. i'll never buy a ford again, what they say is true, ford... fix or repair daily. san tan has done nothing to help. do not buy from san tan or a ford! screwed me the focus and now screwing me with the fusion!! under 36k miles and my lug nuts have to be replaced!? and ford saying it's not a warrantied item!? what a joke!!!!!!! wish i could drive this crap off a cliff"
117,"they've closed for good, though were selling groupons even weeks after they closed for supposedly renovations.  i knew things were going badly, but to deliberately defraud calgarians?"
118,walked past again today and it appears to be open. i guess they were just doing a renovation.
119,the repairman came in early morning and seem irritated that he has to work.   chrged me $459 to add freon and said it's all fixed.  one week later my ac is down again.  i don't want to call this company again and gets charged for repairs that does not last long
120,"the place needs a serious renovation. i think it has a lot of potential to attract more people but it's lacking a lot. 

first off, its unhygenic as staff don't use gloves to make the sandwiches. i see them mop the floor and make someone's sandwich the next second...um gross!!

second, they use very cheap ingredients and it doesn't look fresh. i only come here when i'm really in a pinch but there are definitely much better and cleaner places around the area."
121,"parker & sons replaced a blower motor on my a/c in august 2013 and although it seemed very expensive 1500+, they were very nice and professional. this summer my unit stopped blowing cold air, and they told me my compressor was bad and i needed a replacement compressor or a new unit. they ""recommended"" a newer version of the same style unit i already have because of the over/under configuration on the roof and because the manufacturer quit making my model.  that would cost 7,500, or a new compressor would cost 2,750. 

i called another company for a second opinion. they actually had my exact a/c unit in stock for $5,300 installed, or a new compressor for 2,500. but as it turned out, none of this was necessary. 

the other company came out and repaired my unit for $480, vs. the thousands of dollars parker & sons wanted to charge.

i showed them the estimate and diagnosis invoice from parker & sons, and they told me they could not find any of the problems that parker & sons had listed on the invoice. 

i am afraid i must agree with one of the other reviews on here about them being really friendly and nice, but very untrustworthy. you may be sweating in august with no a/c, but get another opinion!"
122,was never mentioned they were under renovation. front lobby is in what was once a room. pictures are deceiving the place looked nothing like the pictures on their web page. to their credit the inside of the renovated rooms are very well done
123,"would have loved to try this restaurant with great reviews & after seeing a post on their instagram yesterday of a poutine, came down only to be told they are closed for renovations. maybe this should be included in their social media posts."
124,"this is the most expensive and worst system you can buy! i would give it zero if possible! they system is constantly going out. i have had them at my home 4 times in 5 months to repair! 
do not buy this system! 

this product is sold at best buy! run away!"
125,"just stay away from this company.  samsung sent them out to repair my less than 2 year old dryer and they missed the first appointment and then argued with me saying they never setup the appointment.  my hands were tied because this is who samsung said could fix my dryer so i setup the 2nd appointment and the repair man was at my house for a total of 15 minutes, from when he parked his scion xb in front of my house till he drove off.  well, in this rushed repair he broke the touch panel on my dryer and the drum sounds like it's rubbing on something inside and is extremely loud.  this all started off in october, i am still dealing with this issue in december!  i now am dealing with samsung to send another repair company out to fix what this incompetent company broke.  if you value your sanity you will stay away from this company."
126,"home ironing station
reliable j 420 iron maven with aluminum sole plate,
$300 + shipping / toronto, canada 

don't buy it.... not worth dealing with luigi the repair man at reliable in toronto... he is defensive and aggressive... the first time my iron broke after 3 weeks... he told me it was my fault as i must have the wrong ironing board... then when i disclaimed this, and repeated that the plastic casing had fallen off... he said... ""well don't get defensive"". 

a year later... upon that return... but a month or so after warranty due to the weeks it was away,.. the iron died again.... when called, he claimed the iron was 3 and half years old and therefore not his responsibility... when pushed that it was actually only just over a year old... he said... ""well, your iron was smashed up last time in shipping and i had to repair it for free... if it gets smashed again... you'll have to pay for it."" is this a threat? i am not sure.

if you end up with a lemon .... there's no recourse with this company.
best avoid them all together."
127,went in for emissions test.  they told me i failed and tried to push me to make repairs.  i went to another place and passed without doing anything.  these guys are scammers.  i am in the process of reporting this to mto.  good luck to anyone going here.
128,"had sep come out and dig in my yard and cut ten cable to my century link and then covered the hole before century link came to make the repair.  we were left without any internet or cable for a couple of day.  they acted put out every time  i asked a question,  even though 3 of 4 were just sitting on their tool buckets talking.  overall a negative experience,  not impressed."
129,i just called hearth & patio to ask about a very small crack in the firebox of a wood-burning fireplace to see if it's okay or if it could be repaired or if the firebox should be replaced. the person i spoke with didn't seem at all interested in helping me and didn't seem to realize that a call of this sort is a sales opportunity.  what a disappointment.
130,this restaurant  went out of business which i knew would happen. they aren't temporary closed due to renovation. word out in the streets and other restaurants near by there done.
131,"had a terrible experience here after their renovations... workers were yelling at each other, my order was first 30 minutes late then it came out completely wrong and had to wait an extra 15 minutes just for them to fix t.. reficulous"
132,( closed indefinitely ) my xbox recently broke down on me yesterday and i decided to take to vegas game repair which is also called the guru crew. they seem to have a bunch of different yelp business listings but don't be fooled they are the same place. the place has been completely emptied. there sign in the windows says it will be closed indefinitely.  i'm glad they didn't get a chance to run off with my xbox system.
133,my family has been a member at the arizona science center for years. it has been a great place to take my kids for a long time. the problem is that the place has fallen into a sad state of disrepair. i made a point to count today and there are over 20 exhibits and interactives that are either completely broken or in serious need of repair. with this in mind i unfortunately will not be renewing our annual membership.
134,"not trustworthy. the home warranty company sent these folks out to handle a stopped up drain. the technician made only a cursory effort to locate the main clean-out, then decided to root the problem from a roof vent. this makes the repair ""not covered"" because there was no main clean-out. 

this was a job done for my client. i went to the house and in a brief search located the main clean-out. (i am not a plumber) the technician did not indicate to my client that the repair would not be covered and insisted that he get a check from her for the work. 

the technician also attempted to sell her a main clean out installation for an additional $1500. he could have spent a few minutes and found the clean out, but instead attempted to intimidate the homeowner into paying for unneeded work.

this company's technician acted unethically and took advantage of a first time home owner. do not use them. we have also filed a complaint with the home warranty company."
135,"first time here after the renovation. was very unsatisfying. crab dip appetizer took 20 mins to come out. it tasted bland and had 4 pieces of crab sprinkled on top. main entree came out 15 mins later. fish extremely bland even with extra aioli sauce. 

really hoped for a better experience."
136,"the dishwasher they installed needed additional repairs. according to the ge official repairman,  the dishwasher was installed incorrectly. ge repairmen went into detail re faulty installation."
137,they certainly get pissy when you want to get a second estimate since theirs seemed so high.  have never been treated so badly for wanting second opinion or having to talk to my husband about the suggested repairs.
138,"adds a ""repair order charge"" based on labor. claims there's signs everywhere about it. another $49.95 added to labor charges of $1,071.38 on my bill of $2,264.65. beware!!"
139,too bad they have c rating again recently.this place just got renovation.from fire.dirty.add more grease.
140,"after less than a week, the redone glass chip repair started peeling again. lesson learned."
141,"roto rooter sent a young plumber named cameron to do some repairs and he acted like he was uninterested in doing the job he was hired to do.  he said he couldn't find the faucets or drain pipes that would fit our sinks.  well if he did a little research he would find that even home depot would probably have what was needed.  on top of that, the estimate to repair and replace what we needed was outrageous.  no thanks!  for what he wanted to charge for a job that he didn't even know if he could get the parts for, i ended up telling cameron to leave and hired somebody cheaper.  roto rooter overcharges and sends out people that don't seem to have a clue."
142,"thank god they are closing this outlet.   what a trashy ripoff business.   we bought a slightly used samsung refrigerator with an extended warranty on the assurance of the manager.   however, the fridge never worked from the beginning and the manager was of no help in getting it fixed or replaced.  after repeated calls to samsung, samsung went out of their way to finally have it repaired...all of which could have been handled locally by sears outlet.   can't wait for sears to go finally close its doors."
143,"had parker and sons come out and do a pre summer ac check up. four hours  after quoting us $1200 for ""needed repairs"" to a 4 year old well running unit after our ac isn't working, then they are too busy to send someone out to fix what they broke until tomorrow. now i'm suck in a hot house unable to sleep. never using them again."
144,this used to be fletchers and i really liked the family feel. now they are firestone and completely changed the vibe. it is very corporate feeling now and extremely over priced. i needed to get my air conditioning compressor replaced they quoted me more than double what i just paid to get it repaired.
145,"there are some legitimate good points in the other positive reviews, like the size and layout of this venue.  and i'm sure at some point in its history it was beautiful and still holds lots of great memories for people.  

but let's get real.  this place is a dump.  dirty, hot, and crumbling around you.  and so filled with smoke it's disgusting.  i could write several paragraphs describing the filth and disrepair of this place, but it's not worth it.  if there is a show playing here that you want to see, you'll go anyway, just like i did.  but i am really hoping that none of the acts i want to see will choose to play here because it was awful."
146,"what an absolute disaster this company is! incompetent, unprofessional and unfriendly. the technician had no idea what he was doing and after coming out several times was unable to fix the problem. also this guy had such bad body odor that i had to open all the windows and spray air freshener after he left. called a different company, who diagnosed the issue immediately, ordered the correct part, and had it fixed a week later. make sure your home warranty company does not send you these people when you need a repair."
147,i went to this place with my ps3 coz it needed to be fix. the guy said we need to change cd drive and cost $100 to fix it.. so i said well never mind then. i went to the other place by cheyenne called game repair and the guy said its not the cd drive. he fix it and it cost me $50.00. so i'm glad i left when i went to this place..
148,"have stayed here several times due to work having a negotiated rate. quality of room ""renovations"" basically lipstick on a pig...but my last stay, i only had half a deadbolt installed on my door! that plus a general feel of general dinginess had me checking out for good. front desk tried to remedy but i had security concerns since all rooms offered were adjoining, made worse by stonewalling on an exec upgrade despite diamond status and showing ample inventory. 2 stars for gloria in the exec lounge. she's the only reason i gave it another shot!"
149,"this is the worst.

they just finished renovations and still have it screwed up.

there was a line of 50 people literally and 1 cashier.  the staff moved slow.

i had a quater pounder combo and the burger was like it was prepared in the afternoon and the fries were old...

this was horrible and i hope mcdonalds corporate sees this.

unbelievable..."
150,"if i could give zero i would. i was sold a lemon. i'll never buy a ford again, what they say is true, ford... fix or repair daily. san tan has done nothing to help."
151,"even though they were under renovations, they seemed to have been under staffed. the room had roaches. called the front desk to see what channel was hbo and the front desk clerk told us that they didn't have it instead of just admitting that she didn't know. when our key wouldn't work, there was only one person available to let us in our room and he was very unprofessional. when he was asked to let us in our room, he said ""no, i'm not on the clock anymore"". then proceeded to walk to the door until he realized we were standing there. then he decided to help us. i'm sure we won't ever stay here again. i'm only giving 1 star because i have to."
152,when i questioned the owners about his bill he went ballistic shouting and said i now only accept cash now. do your due diligence i did not and paid for it.  big time overcharged for a basic repair.
153,"a/c unit was making a loud squealing noise.  technician came out, said the compressor going to need replaced in 3-4 years.  suggested a repair to extend its life.  less than 24hrs later and $450 the issue is not resolved.   after reading other reviews, my impression is this is not a reputable company.  when i called to make the appointment the person on the other end kept trying to get me to sign up for a annual plan.  i refused the offer as it sounds like nothing more than extortion.   i would not recommend this company at all."
154,"the monday night zumba w samantha is great and worth driving to get a good workout but this gyms women's restroom is in need of repair, it's dingy & dirty."
155,"a little over a year ago i had francisco out at my home to rebuild a patio. he sent me over a quote a day or so after he came out. we then scheduled him to come out for the job. he never showed nor called me or even answered my calls!!! i couldn't believe that he actually did that for the fact when he came he talked very professionally, and assured his business was everything and took it his business very serious. ha what a joke! he then called me 2 weeks later apologizing and we scheduled another day. yes! i scheduled another time for him to come out because i was desperate to have it repaired before my daughter's 1st birthday. guess what??? he never showed or called again! till this day i never heard from him. i would not trust him nor ever refer anyone to him in my life."
156,"diversified roofing may install roofs but beware at what they say and provide information about your roofing job or repairs for a poorly done past installation. i received a call from a court appointed agent from a class action suit on energy panels that were installed in 2008. the surrounding tiles begin to slip and slide down the roof on 2012. when i called the subcontractor (diversified roofing) about the issue, they denied at the time they ever performed the job and had no record of it. fortunately, i had all of the documents and they then acknowledged that the work was performed by them. they came over and also acknowledge at the time that sub-standard material were used as lining and they did replace some of it with current standard material. they never touched the solar tiles. now, some of the same so called ""repaired tiles"" are slipping and sliding and when the court appointed agent called them for information, the claim to have done the repair job ""recently"" and allegedly are seeking compensation. they may install roofs but how ethical are they? beware! some jobs they do may be standard but the one they did many years ago, not recently...was poor."
157,i would give this place 0 stars if possible they did the worst possible job on my repair they didn't fix everything that should have been fixed and the fixes that they did didn't last absolutely horrible horrible horrible horrible worst ever never use this place
158,"played the south course day after christmas, the greens are new this year and are literally the hardest i have ever played. hard, as in concrete. approach shots onto the green are not rewarded! all 4 in our party rolled off the green all day. you will not need your divot repair tool here. there are much better courses in scottsdale for the money."
159,"zero stars. the room was not what we booked and because we arrived in the evening due to it being christmas day, they claimed they sold out of our room. our room overlooked a parking lot and despite our attempts to have the room we booked, they claimed they were still sold out every day. we woke up to no hot water due to a supposed renovation, dirty linens and rude staff every where you turn. do not spend one dime on the paris las vegas because you will regret it. go right across the street to the bellagio."
160,so frustrating. i wish i could give a zero. we are in the middle of a repair and for over a month they have not answered calls or web requests. i contacted corporate and they haven't been able to give any answers.
161,"i completely understand and agree with all the  reviews of this ""business"". if you are not forced to use this company do to your home warranty companies' contract with these people,do not use these people. i had two separate units that i needed repaired at the same time and they were unable get it done in a timely manner.   one of my units is still having a problem i told them and they never returned my call to fix it.  if you are paying out-of-pocket for your repairs find another company, you'll be glad that you did."
162,they were closed for renovations and when i called friday night they said will reopen on saturday morning at 11.   we arrived at 230 and there was a sign on the door saying reopen at 1130. we went in and there were 3 tables of people. the staff didn't make eye contact then finally came over to the door and said they were closed.  i mentioned the conversation i had the night before and they said they got busy and decided to close until 4. not impressed.
163,"worst experience i have ever had. never completed repair and caused damages to my shower system. never returned calls are showed up to finish job. used them through american home shield. total incompetence. 
elliot rovinsky"
164,"do not bother calling these guys.  absolutely terrible!!!  had to come out 3 times to fix dryer.  double charged my wife and i calling the first a ""hold"" and the second the ""actual charge.""  then refused to refund the charge.  repair guy left my upstairs smelling like an ashtray.  dryer still not fixed.  i asked to refund everything and again they refused."
165,"beware beware beware,
total rip off and con artist.

unlicensed and ""f"" rating on the bbb when he was running thrower home improvement and now has changed name to your best handyman.

don't be stupid.  find someone else ."
166,for it being an 18 and over place the girls do look a little weathered. it's an okay place but they're pushy as any other strip club. this place could use a renovation.
167,broken equipment that takes weeks to get repaired!  i always report it to the front desk; it does not seem to matter since it stays broken for weeks.  very disappointing!
168,"diagnosed an a/c damper issue and wanted to charge me $4,000 for the repair + ancillary parts they said wouldn't fix the problem without.  got a 2nd opinion and ended up paying $700 to the other company...and without the ancillary parts.

beware of lies and partial truths!

reply to precision air

""guarantee"" is your word.  never said that in my post.

also, your tech did end up telling a lie when he told me the dampers would not function without installing a new zone control board.  i have new damper motors that are running with my existing control board that was not replaced."
169,"these guys are the worst repair company that i've ever dealt with in my 51 years.  they lose orders, do not show up for several agreed upon appointment times and don't have the decency to provide the owners name so i can file a complaint.  i would be shocked if they have even one positive rating.  my next complaint will be filed with the bbb because this was absolutely unacceptable."
170,they repaired my riding lawnmower and it burned to the ground the next time i used it.  they took no responsibility but could provide no explanation of how a fire started.  wouldn't even work with me on a replacement mower.  would give 0 stars if that was an option.
171,if first american tries to send these guys to your house immediately request someone else. as soon as the repairman came in the house i could tell he did not want to be here. he spent a total of 10 minutes looking and never really listened to what i was saying. it felt like he was more worried about finding a way to blame us than finding the real problem. he didn't do anything. i wish i could give zero stars.
172,"nothing professional about this company. my brand new unit was installed wrong, which caused the condensation to leak through my ceiling. i woke up to a complete mess and a waterlogged ceiling which had to be repaired as well as another expensive fix for the ac unit. the 3 stooges once said, ""don't worry, we always fix it right the 2nd time!"" these guys can't even do that. a completely shady business to be avoided at all costs."
173,"i had parker & sons out today.  the first employee who came out was reasonable & courteous.  unfortunately, he could not find the problem with a snake, could not find the cleanout, and needed someone with a camera.  so - he called out a 2nd guy but assured me there would be no additional charge for this.  he gave me a total estimate of $270.00 work, which i authorized.  an hour later, another employee shows up with the camera (i would love to tell you their names, and would have reviewed them on parker & sons website, but the name on the invoice was joseph l. and much to my surprise, there is no  joseph l. on the website (you have to  pick the employee to submit a review).  so - they are able to find the cleanout this time, run a snake with a camera, and showed me the picture (which, to be honest, i had no idea what i was looking at).  the snake cleared the clog, my sinks and tubs drained but that wasn't the end.  they told me i had roots pushing displacing a joint on the main line about 6-7 ft down and that it would be ""thousands"" to fix (later they gave me an actual written quote of  6500.00).  in the meantime, they wanted to hydrojet the drain for an additional 1500.00 which i told them i could not afford immediately.  i told them i'd have to pay for just what was done today and asked them to give me an estimate and let me think about the rest.  they then charged me 550.00.  i questioned this because the estimate was 270 - and the first employee had assured me there was no charge for the camera.  they told me ""it is what it is.""  believe me - my head was swirling at this point - upset about a potential major repair - but really feeling like they were trying to gauge me as a single woman.  i never agreed to any additional labor or fees - and yet, they still charged them.  they did tell me that if i did the complete repair (6500.00), the 1500.00 would be applied to which i asked them why i would trust that when they had given me an estimate for 270 and ended up charging 550!  never again!  buyer beware!"
174,avoid at all costs! they misdiagnosed my problem and charged me thousands for repairs i did not need. my ac still doesn't work. these guys are scammers that take advantage of people. i hope you guys can sleep at night knowing you stole from a schoolteacher!
175,their repairs are ridiculously expensive- $13 to shorten sweatpants. i won't be returning.
176,"i like fred and the people he has working for him, i believe the repairs they did are solid, however like another reviewer posted they left me with additional problems do to their work. they replaced a beam on our house and our front porch that was sinking. sadly in the process of lifting the house to replace the beam they bent the door. when i brought this up i was told their is nothing they can do. the door repair guy confirmed it is their error and the only thing to do is either a new door or shave down the new beam. also the finish on our front porch sucks. the brush marks look really bad, and i've shown it to several people that agree. i reached out to fred to get him to look at it and he agreed to come look at it and then never showed, called or emailed. i really wanted to leave a positive review but given the cost of the job and the lack of detail i can't."
177,in my opinion these guys are liars and con artists. the will lure you in with a $35 or $39 deal then try to keep your gear and steel more from you. no call before repair as agreed and they tried to charge $45 for a $35 part. upsell lie upsell. avoid these clowns!
178,they quoted me $800 for a repair.  i just had another honest company out and they did the same repair for $305.  a1 garage door is running a scam - do not hire them.
179,my relationship with these guys has gone from a love/hate relationship to only a hate one.  again they screwed up on the appts.  also promised a repair quote today and i still have not gotten it.  i think they have totally convinced me that i should not deal with them for anything anymore.
180,"boris does shoddy work that he doesn't stand behind. he repaired my luggage 6 months ago and when the same problem resurfaced he blamed it on wear and tear. did not even want to talk about it. 
very unprofessional."
181,"stay as far away as you can. 
rip offs!!! they send out guys who do not know what they are doing & then attempt to overcharge you after they make the repair worse do to poor quality workmanship. it was bad to even give 1 star at all"
182,"it's ture. if you want your time wasted, just hire. this handyman .he forgets,an loses his appointment. we are in the 20th century. who writes,on paper any longer. he makes his own schedule. just a waste of time. a non professional. really get a google canlader an write your dates,in there. it goes ever were you go. if i could give him a negative
i would. i just don't turth this handyman, he not reliable."
183,worst installation ever!  installers did major damage to brand new kitchen hardwood floors and the company will not repair or even acknowledge that they have a responsibility.
184,"poor quality product. three years after owning the counter cracked all around the tap [which they installed] and then a few months later three more cracks in the main body of the counter. they initially tried to blame us for the cracks but their repair person said the damage is not consistent with consumer damage and the owner should get involved to work out a replacement under the supposed ""lifetime"" warranty, which is an obvious lie. my once beautiful counter now has two ugly seams on it and poly resin filled cracks. they have completely ignored my requests to have the counter replaced, and did not respond to the better business bureau requests for resolution. this is an expensive product that doesn't hold up. don't waste your money, go with real stone, that will last."
185,"we didn't actually use these guys we just got a bid from them. they spent a few minutes looking at  the job and said it's  $12,000.
 we spent the day digging the lineup ourselves and paid another plumber 5 hundred dollars to repair it"
186,"the great yelp reviews led me to take my marshall combo to mtroniks for repair.  unfortunately i did not have a positive experience like everybody else.  after 5 weeks and no status updates, i gave up and picked up the amp.  still looking for an amp tech."
187,this place is straight up dishonest and shady. i called to get an estimate to replace a shower handle. i was given a shocking quote of $ 1500.00. the estimate said i needed major repairs and i needed to cut a hole in my walls. the truth i got the repairs for $ 100.00 from someone who is not out to rip you off !!!!!!
188,"this happened several months ago. half of the vents on the first floor were not opening. they came over, diagnosed the problem correctly, loosened the valve on the motor that wasnt opening, and all was fine. they did say if it happened again, i would need to replace the motor. about 4 weeks later, it happened again. they came out and said in addition to the vent motor, i would need to replace some other valve thing that would cost over $1200.00 since it was time consuming and they had to replace all the refrigerant. well i called another company who did a full diagnostic and all they said i needed was to replace the failed valve motor and not that other much more expensive repair. long story short,my system worked great all summer. no problem at all. lesson to be learned: always get a second opinion if a company wants to charge you a lot of money on a repair."
189,very disappointed at how cheap the repair came out. the new front bumper won't stay clipped down :(
190,"contacted them about a console repair and they kept inturrupting me constantly to deal with other customers.  attitude was condescending an arrogant.  the person i spoke to also flat out lied to me.  this is not the way to run a business.  a really shady operation. oh and one more thing, the ""melissa b."" review above should either be removed or classifed as advertising as it was posted by one of their employees."
191,"we have used several professional venders over the past two years for various projects and this was the worst experience yet, not even close. a two day project took almost 4 months, three different ""handymen"", one complete redo and the project still needs attention (caulking, sanding, painting) to actually be considered complete. poor choice of material, bad cuts and uneven surfaces led to the complete ""redo"" in which still is not finished. while most of the project is now level, the work is far from professional. wooden handrails were never caulked or sanded, so we advised our children, and guests to keep clear to avoid splinters. we are totally missing a wooden support under a section of railing while a different section remains completely unpainted. mind you it does have the original coat of paint but not the newly quoted layer to match. ultimately, this experience has been unacceptable and disappointing. 

we are absolutely unsatisfied and do not recommend hands4hire to anyone."
192,this place is a joke dont buy furniture here it is super cheap and extreamly expensive. i picked up a bed frame that was supposed to be solid wood however the pressbord fell apart 3 days after install and they refuse to do anything about it it was delevired on the 1st and now i have to wait till the 30th for there repair company to come out and try and fix it. so i have a 1700$ piece of crap that i can't sleep on. jiant joke of a company
193,"zero rating. 
we have a home warranty with american home shield company who sent out this company to repair our dryer. they came out four times to try to fix. said it was the motor and said they replaced it. came out after that several times and ended up saying it was the lint that was causing the squeaking sound and noise when our lint filter/hose is perfectly clean. so we paid $100.00 for nothing. tech is angry and just walks out without saying anything and will not communicate with you. 
do not use this company."
194,they charged $300 and my air conditioner was still not repaired. i would not recommend them to anyone. i'll never use them again. if i could have given them a 0 rati
195,"played the course on 6/23/18 and i was looking forward to a good round on a golf course that gcu purchased and completely renovated over 1 year ago.  i have to be honest, don't waste your money here until the fix the course, it was in terrible shape.  fairways had lots of repair areas and greens had lots of barren spots and areas even though the greens appear to be rolled the condition was unacceptable for this time of year.  as a shareholder i was disappointed at the hundreds of thousands of dollars that was spent to revive this course only to have it in this condition."
196,avoid at all costs!  i called danny and scheduled repairs on 3 separate occasions.  each and every time he flaked on me and did not even bother to let me or my tenants know.  it was a complete waste of my time in coordinating repairs between him and my tenants.  i gave him the benefit of the doubt each time but by the 3rd time he didn't even bother to respond to me after confirming repair date and time the previous week.
197,repair and sales are terrible. would not recommend them to anyone. ignore issues until completely broken or out of warranty.
198,"i would never have them do a job. we had them repair our water softener and water heater 3 years ago and clean out all outlets, very expensive.. our water heater just went out and they could not replace for 2-days with a bunch of running around and still cost $675 with a warranty. manager said he would come by and make sure everything is good , still waiting a month later. not a good company!!!"
199,"i have used this company in the past and it was fine, albeit expensive. this time, they sent me a melvin.  the faucets in both of my bathrooms were leaking. i was charged $700 (!) to ""repair"" the faucets, but i was told that they will need to be repaired again in the not-so-distant future. once the work was done and i paid the bill, i was told not to use the showers for 24 hours. after that period, i used the master bath shower and realized that the faucets were put on to where both handles go turn the same way (as opposed to the correct way where the right handle turns right to turn on the water and the left handle turns left). when i finished, i turned off the water and the handles were all cockeyed, not even close to being straight. i won't ever give this company my money again. they are definitely off my list of preferred vendors for both my house and my investment properties."
200,i'm so angry at this company. six years ago i had to buy an air conditioner unit from them. they sold me the wrong type i think knowingly because i am a female and still six years later i'm having issues. and i was a new home owner and i had called them two times after that and have gotten melvins those other times as well. do not believe them. do not use them. they are liars. they are charlatans. they will screw you over every chance they can get it i swear because every time i have used them they have ruined everything they have so-called fixed because i have had to call other companies to fix what they had supposedly repaired or installed.
201,"i am pretty upset that i waited 1.5 hours to pick up my tickets for tonight's show. another show-goer just happened to look on the laugh factory's facebook page which said that the club was closed for repairs.  there were no signs on the door or anything indicating that the establishment was  closed. poor business.  too bad, i was really looking forward to the show."
202,they are closed for renovations. a little further down the road is another with a drive through at a gas station
203,was ripped of by this company wasn't able to repair my fridge took 660.00 in cash changed piece by piece and still wanted more left fridge the way it was not repaired said there was nothing he was prepared to do kept the cash 660.00 avoid this rip off no going legal to teach him a lesson he wont forget easy  cant and will never recommend this company to anybody
204,"i learned something that shocked me - morris jenkins repair techs make commissions on any parts/new systems they sell! i absolutely couldn't believe that. that simply invites unethical behavior.
end of story. i first posted this on facebook and had a large number of responses of example potential ripoffs by mj (thankfully, in most cases, my facebook friends requested a second recommendation and learned they needed much less work than mj tried to up-sell to them!) i then posted it to nextdoor (14k people!) and received tons of negative examples. i can't figure out how they are still in business? i guess because of their dumb commercials?"
205,"do not buy a house here. go to mountains edge or somewhere else. as a home-owner here in rhodes ranch, i wish i was not. should've moved to paseos, vistas, or somewhere else. pay over $100.00+ in monthly hoa fee to be treated like a complete animal by the security guards here. yes, being harassed by them for doing nothing wrong. get rhodes security guards calling you profanity doing nothing wrong. yeah, i'm sure whoever reads my yelp review will might who i am. especially if you live inside rhodes ranch too. i'm one of the few who runs on the road around the neighborhood. or even road cycling in and out of the neighborhood to red rock, etc...  well, i guess the people working in security department isn't paid enough money? some of them are nice. or i'd say a lot. but some of them sure give rhodes ranch a complete bad name. 

also, if you purchased your home before the builder changed to century communities, then i guess you're screwed. if you're trying to receive any original information for the interior, exterior, etc... of your home, then you won't be able to. so if you're trying to do paint touch-ups or any other interior repairs, then good luck. it seems that hoa department can't retrieve that information anymore. i also thought that conflicted with cc&r rules too. correct me if i'm wrong. century communities who's the builder now can't pull that information. since corrupt jim rhodes sold the neighborhood, the information is all gone. 

get constant people speeding up and down the sub-division streets. and, i'm saying well, well above the speed limit. with that being said, security department or hoa doesn't take into account of what may be done to improve this. instead they'd just rather add more speed bumps or sit on the road of the main road tracking speeds. or that, wait until a child gets hit. i've reporting some of the plate numbers to the security too. 

on the positive side, neighbors seem to be nice. gym is nice. just wish it was a bit larger. especially with how large rhodes ranch has got. on a second note, do not leave your garage door open here. break-ins here may not be as high as mountains edge, but things will get stolen fast. do yourself a favor, want to know more about the original builder of rhodes ranch. well go to http://www.saveredrock.com. save yourself some time. good day."
206,"it's the start of summer and my air conditioning isn't working in part of my house. was told i needed new ducting and a thermostat to fix the problem. great when can you start? ""we can't help you till after summer."" there is 4 months of heat coming and you guys can't help me till after summer? paid $80 to have them tell me i need repairs but they are too busy and can't make them. they have time to inspect your unit and charge you for that but not enough time to actually make any of the necessary repairs to get my air conditioning working.

if you plan on getting your air repaired try another company that will actually have time to make the repairs they tell you are needed."
207,"find another builder if you think let stepper build a house for you.
they put a damaged bathtub in my brand new house and said they 're gonna repair it easily. they did a horrible repair job on the bathtub i could still see the crack through the touch up !!! and now i called the construction manager to complain about it he didn't answer also i found  water leaking  in the basement they didn't  even know where it from and why.. and no explanation so far.
how unbelievably they work!!!
and don't trust realtors in stepper show home they say they're stepper ' realtor and yours too but in a different situation they turn away never on your side."
208,quotes me $100 to replace a molly bolt & screw then gets smart when i state it's a single screw.  well s@rew you!  ever wonder why handymen gets a bad wrap?  this guy is your answer.
209,"repaired a brake line my chevy s-10.  four years later, i find that the repair could not pass safety inspection in another state.  i'd call it shoddy sub-standard work."
210,"do not! i repeat, do not use these people. they do not know what they are doing. instead of doing a proper repair, they rewired my unit and it went from a two stage unit to a one stage. i had another company come out to check their work because my units didn't sound right and they found their repairs to fault my and inadequate. dont do it!"
211,"played siena this past sunday.  i've always enjoyed playing here.  when i made the tee time, i specifically asked if the course was playable since this is overseeding and aeration season. the attendant said they never closed for overseeding, but course was in good shape and playable.  not so much.  almost every fairway had spots that should have been marked as ground under repair as they were graded and muddy w/virtually no grass on many spots. we were charged $65 for the round. it's unconscionable that they could charge that for a course in such bad shape. i understand the need for revenue, but this was ridiculous. at the very least, they should have been a cut rate of around $35.  not sure i'll be returning since i feel i was duped."
212,"incredibly rude and unprofessional. they might provide adequate garage door repair but the lack of consideration, respect and professionalism are not worth it."
213,ripoff artists! beware! charge 10x the actual cost! do your homework! quoted $800-900 for repair. i researched the part. turns out it was $137 for the part. you do the math!
214,"i had certified install a new havoc system in the summer.  due to the age of my house the furnace is installed in the attic.  not only did their crews leave behind left over installation materials in my attic, but due to a faulty installation the furnace was leaking condensation into the ceiling of the room below, damaging the drywall and my furnishings.  certified came out and repaired the issue with the furnace and dried out the room, but after weeks of follow up the company was only willing to send out one of their employees to paint over the damaged ceiling drywall in hopes that would fix the issue (no mention of reimbursement for my damaged possessions).  i'll be looking into small claims court but in reality i'll probably be paying for the repairs myself."
215,"what a dump. every cheer competition is here and it's worse and worse every time. their ac is ""broken"" when it's 115 degrees outside. so now children are borderline passing out. they should start doing these a a school that is in better condition and not in a dumpy area. if the school cannot get a repair person out they need to hand out water to the kids."
216,"i had been going to golden glow for almost a year when in mid january i found a note on the door saying that they were closed for renovations and would reopen in 2 weeks.  well, that was over 2 months ago and they still haven't opened.  have they closed permanently?  i had recently purchased a package so they owe me money if that's the case!  anyone happen to know if they are going to reopen????"
217,saturday evening before a sun's game. hanny's: oh six bar seats are shut down so a guy can do some repair work. really? i don't want to sit at a table. bye
218,"so glad i never stopped into this place i called to set up appointment and the guy who answered was so rude off the bat. when i call a business i introduce myself by saying my name, this guy refused and just asked why i'm calling bmw repair, never introduced himself or anything. i will not do business with a place like this. seems low class for high end products."
219,i took my roomba here to be repaired because it was spinning in circles. they said they would fix if it was under $100 or they would call and tell me how much it would be to repair. when i went to pick it up it was $150 and it's still spinning in circles. they will not return emails/calls so that was a waste. take your business somewhere else.
220,"repair man was expecting large repair before even seeing it, and they totally dropped the ball on scheduling the repair. two weeks later and no part or repair scheduled. frustrating to deal with."
221,"true view is a very difficult company to work with. i needed windows repaired on the house i was flipping. to date, the work is still not complete. so far they have come to the house seven times, the next visit will be eight. plain and simple i need all the windows repaired for new a buyer. the closing was three weeks away, calling them they said it takes 7-10 days to order materials. the house closed on 4-10-2019. each time i called and asked for assistance i got the same reply, it takes 7-10 days to order windows. then i got an email stating the windows would be installed on april 4th, well when the technician came out it was only to measure a window. they want you to work within there policy and procedures; your needs and requests are secondary. save yourself the grief and headaches go to another company."
222,avoid at all costs! last year my home warranty company sent these guys out to evaluate a light switch. their guy tried selling me a new water conditioner instead. he never removed the switch but stated it was not covered under our home warranty. i had to fight with my warranty company to get them to return and re-evaluate. the manager cancelled the appt. and never notified me. i waited for the 4 hr window and called. they refused to come out. i again fought with my warranty company to have a second opinion which they reluctantly did. allstate electric came out and said the switch was covered and replaced it. this year i again had an issue which i put in a home warranty trouble call. unfortunately ideal grabbed the problem and i had to set up an appointment. after waiting two days in a row for them to come out and not coming i called my home warranty and asked that allstate electric come out. they did and gave a 2 hour window vs a 4 hr window. they actually showed up before the appointment and repaired the issue. if you have a warranty do not place your trouble call online. call them and ask for allstate.
223,"extremely rude staff. completely unwilling to help and only responded with sarcasm. i asked their repair guy if they fixed virtual boys, and he responded with ""this isn't 1992, so you're out of luck."""
224,"since i had our new a.c. unit installed i have had to replace the thermostat and a fan in the new a.c. unit. i'm not too impressed with hendels. they where quick to come out slow to repair.. almost like ""they have my money and they will take time to repair."" as they failed to keep 3 repair appointments due to another job that took too long. not impressed with them anymore.. do your research before making a big purchase here."
225,"updated, 7/31: i was contacted by two men and a truck recently, and a reimbursement of my washer repair bill was proposed. i accepted, and received a check of $150 from the company a few days ago. i take this as an acceptance of accountability, though protracted, and have moved on."

227,"they finally sent a company to look at the furniture, the guy that came told me that he is only here to take picture and rc willey will make the decision.  i got a call from rc willey a few days later and i was told  they will not repair because it was not a problem with the leather but with the make of the furniture.  they also told me that this was based on the evaluation of the guy that came and took the pictures .  i was told lie after lie and i am not satisfied with the lies they told me over and over.  buyer be ware !!!! do not purchase their extended warranty, rc willey will not honor it."
228,"this company charged us twice the amount quoted and had all our belongings hostage in their vans because they couldn't finish the job in the one day promised. they literally packed a box with 12 sheets of tissue paper and half used roll of tape, they used wardrobe boxes, poorly taped, for nearly everything. the worst thing is that they broke my baby grand piano and wouldn't repair it. i have filed complaints with the arizona attorney office and the bbb. steer clear of this company."
229,"this company is the biggest ripoff i have ever encountered in my 54 years of working with heating and air repair companies. i called mj for regular seasonal maintenance. they quoted me more than $4000 for a repairs stating i would die if i turned on my unit. i knew this was not accurate so i called a reputable repair man and found out there was absolutely nothing wrong with my unit, in fact he said it was in amazingly good shape. he actually showed me where everything quoted by mj was a complete lie including needing new exhaust blower motor which was clearly working perfectly. i'm fact, every part on the mj quote was working perfectly and in very good shape. i later found out these repairmen work on commission. all they want to do is sell you a new unit. mr jenkins you should be ashamed of yourself and perhaps investigated. i wonder how many people have been ripped off from these rip off artists. i am so grateful i got a second opinion. run from this company."
230,"they came right away to do the work and did an ok job. still had the same problems with the doors, said they couldn't repair those problems.but they did re-key them. 

i called someone else and the did more work and repaired the door problems that a-1 said they couldn't."
231,"we have a contract with morris jenkins and won't be renewing. they get 2 stars because they are prompt. our garbage disposal was leaking so we called mj. they wanted to charge us $485 ($200 for disposal + $285 for labor). we declined and purchased a new one ourselves and had our handyman to put it in.  saved almost $300. we're scheduled for a regular a/c maintenance next week.  i'm quite sure they'll ""find"" something wrong and want to charge hundreds of dollars. each time they come out, they try selling us something. it is quite obvious that their techs double as salespersons."
232,"a bunch of lying ba*****ds. do yourself a favor and stay away. all i got from them is lies, aggravation and an unrepaired washer."
233,"the absolute worst company i've ever worked with.  first they got caught using the wrong size pipe to repair plumbing.  then they took months to complete the job with workers not showing up over and over again.  to do the job, they tore up the concrete in driveway (later learned they tore up way more than they needed to), then after they fixed the pipes, they refused to repair the concrete, leaving giant, unsafe, unsightly holes."
234,"horrible company. they fail to answer calls in a timely manner, staff is rude, and they failed to properly fix my a.c. it broke down a,year after the,repair due to poor workmanship leaving ne,and my family without a.c. in august. don't waste your time or money."
235,"two years ago they came when i needed them because my air was dead, they fixed a dead ""cap"" but then told me there was a leak and i'd need a new system for $6k.  i had a second opinion done by another company (integrity air, certified by rosie on the house) and he said the freon was probably low from years of a/c techs hooking up their equipment for my annual inspections and a little leaked out each time.  he said he couldn't find any evidence of a leak.  this was after i had paid over $300 for precision to do a ""leak test"" which consisted of going up in the attic for about 4 minutes and making some beeping sounds....at that rate those tests are apparently $4500 per hour!.  i'll never use precision again.

update 2 years later... the system that these con-artists said needed replacing is still working great.

update 3 years later...  the system that 'needed to be replaced' is still working fine and has not had any repairs done.  still mad that i got conned into paying $300 for their ""leak test""."

i posted some of the reviews from tnp gate. don't get screwed by him!!! thank you"
237,"i have used this plumber several times in the past and have been very satisfied.  this week i had a totally different experience.

mr. rooter diagnosed the plumbing problem and gave me a repair estimate of $720.  i had replaced the equipment a year earlier for a cost of $150 plus installation of $200 so the $720 (no equipment replacement) seemed way out of line.  they wouldn't document the estimate when i refused to approve the job.  i called another plumber.  the repair was the replacement of a two foot hose and cost me $168.  i think mr. rooter was way out of line on determining the problem and estimating the cost.

buyer beware."
238,"avoid at all costs!  stay away - completely unprofessional.  do yourself a favor and hire a legitimate professional company that uses competent, trained in the real-world (not crooks or 2 bit repairmen) to do your work.
beyond unprofessional.  and no common sense."

240,spectrum contractors dug on my property and damaged a water line. they are refusing to pay for the damages even after i have supplied them with the documents showing that their contractors were the only people digging over the line where the damage occurred. they are trying to stick us with the $2400 repair bill! do not use these people.
241,"i purchased my 2014 navigator here in december 2013. after a few months, the left lower lift gate tail light failed. they replaced the bulb under warranty. several months latter, the bulb again failed and was wet. they claimed they would replace the light assembly with a new light  assembly. ok, it worked when i picked it up but just yesterday it failed again. when i removed the light assembly, the nuts were loose. then i saw how they repaired it. they forced a new bub in and sealed the area with silicone sealer. that bulb was installed on a angle as it melted some plastic---photo1 shows the damage. photo 2 shows my repair. why didn't they just install the new light assembly as stated and written up? i would not want to pay msrp of $325 + labor for this repair. i bet they never thought i would know how to fix the problem myself."
242,"i used parker and sons for a repair to my plumbing. they do very professional work, but at exorbitant prices!"
243,we were very disappointed in the quality of work performed by moseley last summer for a home renovation. he may be able to do little jobs around the house but lacks the  knowledge and skills for big renovations. do not recommend.
244,"so had a new plumber come today. mind you bliss quoted us between 3,000 and 4,500 for the repair when we initially contacted them and then would never respond again. now i know why.

when a competent plumber showed up the problem was a stuck float. total cost, $150. avoid bliss at all costs as they will try to rip you off!"
245,i found desert investment advisors to be slow and at times unresponsive when it came to agreed upon repairs and fixes. they have made numerous promises but in several cases have taken months to follow through - if at all. you might want to check them and their ceo kirk piersma out at the arizona department of real estate website.
246,"the owner is a jerk. his wife doesn't have much sense either. 
the receptionist called and had to reschedule my appointment due to the owner having ""something come up"". when i did get to meet with him, he was rude and short with me. 
as far as my repair getting done, i was told it could be 8 to 10 weeks! i have an active roof leak and need it fixed before anymore damage is done to my interior. 
needless to say, i ended up calling another company who has already done the work."
247,"had my component here for over two months and they still couldn't figure out what was wrong with it, then charged me $45 dollars. clueless bunch of people with used outdated junk on the shelves. the only reason that i went to this nasty part of town was because my manufacturer recommended them. 
turns out my problem was only a circuit board. my neighbor's son repaired it in five minutes....."
248,update: they still didnt resolve the issue and the truck was voluntarily surrendered due to high cost of repairs. stay away.
249,"never use this company!

251,unsure if i would use them again.  ended up resolving the problem myself after the staff left to another call because he didn't have the part that was needed to repair the issue.
252,my ac stopped cooling and they came right out but estimated repairs very high. so i opted to really pay up and put in a complete new system $7k. they installed in two days but the quality of work was terrible. they had a quality control guy come out a week later and clean up the mess. if i would not have climbed in the attic we would not have known. but the high utilities would have pointed to the poor install. i will never use them again.

254,"the 10 year warranty is not a real thing. we had our house painted in august and have been trying to get touch ups done ever since. at first, the owner (brian brown) would respond to emails - promising to do the repairs himself. but after his father was supposedly hospitalized, we've had zero response to any calls or emails. everything goes to voicemail. are they still in business? such an expensive job with so many false guarantees on their work."
255,"just wanted to upsell.  ac was making noise before he left.  never had that noise before.  asked what it was.  he said he didn't do it!  i said you're a repairman can't you fix it.  be said he hadn't done it.  told him, funny that it happened while he was here.

he went to thermostat.   told me he reset it and left.  when i looked at thermostat, he had turned it off!"

262,"awful place, brought in a churping bird clock that quit working, and, they could not repair it at all, they did not bother. i took it to all about time in phoenix they are the best."
263,now i have to drop them to a 1 star. in dealing with them and trying to get repairs made i had to make a complaint to the better business bureau. the bbb has not gotten a response to the negotiation from garden grove.

269,"it's difficult to reach a live person at this place.  i've called a few times and always get a voicemail.  probably not a good sign.  if i can't reach someone now, how difficult would it be to reach someone in the future for repair or warranty issues.

hopefully, you will have better success.  i'll calling someone else for my shades."
270,"this company will take your money and run!  they are not honest about the installation process, the installer will probably be late, and after the installation you will leave with a list of things you need to ""fix.""  examples of this would be painting broken trim board, fill in grout, coordinate with a stucco repair (don't worry, you have to paint yourself), and deal with a warranty company to deal with any issues after the installation.  they will take your hard earned money and run with it; pass you along to the next person that can deal with you!  save your stress and money!  go anywhere else!"
271,"when they came to give me an estimate i told them four times to give me a picture of what was wrong and needed to be repaired.  they chose to ignore my request.  therefore, i do not know if they did a good job or not, since i never saw what needed to be repaired or the repair that was done.  sometime later, on three occasions, i saw pieces of tile falling on the ground.  i contacted the owner and told him about this.  i asked him what his warranty was.  he said he only guaranteed the work that was done.  since i never knew what was done i was out of luck. the last time i contacted the owner he told me he would call me later that day to see what i was talking about.  he never came.  obviously, he didn't treat me with any respect.  i find his behavior extremely appalling."
272,this gym advertises a free 5day pass. or gym was going to have some renovation done and we have contemplated changing gyms. so we thought it was a great time to give it a try.  first day we showed up  they were hesitant to let us use their pass. second day they said they were not letting our gym members in for free but would for $25. . is that false advertising or what. too bad. had things going for it but we will never join at this point. bad business bad karma.
273,although the park did not seem to be that old it had a run down feel to it. several of the exhibits need repair. the whole park in general needs a little tlc. the several of the habitats were small and did not simulate their natural habitat. i felt sadden when i looked at the animals. i was also surprised at the cost. not only were we charged $34 per person it did not include any of the rides. unfortunately i can not recommend this park nor will we be returning.
274,"the cell repair co. made wrong diagnosis on my cell. replaced parts in error.  when i asked to get compensations on their error, the secretary refused and didn't refer it to manager. trying to avoid the responsibility. i even didn't have a chance to talk to their manager. they refused to return me money."

278,"do not use!  i dealt with judy thaxton to make minor repairs for some small pitted areas on my granite countertop. i received a minimum quote of $250 per hour. the repair guy was here about 50 minutes. i waited a couple hours to let the acrylic dry to check the work. i immediately let judy know that the pitted areas were not completely filled. i was told that they wouldn't be (why i don't know) and that her guy filled more than was what was quoted, which is not true but even if it was, i was paying by the hour, $250. then she told me she gave me a break on the cost, her normal minimum charge is $500 per hour!  needless to say, the repair work was shoddy but i guess i should be happy i only paid $250 not $500 for a bad job."
279,"what a freakin horrible experience. it was the middle of august and my ac broke on a wednesday night. i was under the impression that george brazil was a good company so i called them first. the repair guy that came out was friendly and helpful, but i wasn't really planning on getting it repaired. it is too old, turns out the repair guy doesn't handle new installs, i have to pay him $90 for coming out and then wait for a sales guy to come out.
luckily the sales guy came out the same day, this was thursday. well this sales guy was a huge jerk. he comes in and spends a couple minutes looking around and then tells me that i need to replace all of my ducts. i don't and i know that. it was pretty clear that he was here to sell me new ducts and that was his job. i told him i didn't want the duct work and he got pissed and stormed out of my house. i was in shock, he didn't even want to sell me the ac without the new ducts, which by the way made it a $10,000 plus job. well, i'm not and idiot and i'm not going to get bullied into wasting money, so i let him leave. in the middle of august, i was obviously committed to using them and the shady sales person was using that to force me to get new ducts. luckily, my family knows a trustworthy ac guy named bob over at aireco and he came out right away and got me set up with a better ac unit installed for $5400. 
the problem is, the day i wasted with george brazil meant that bob didn't come out until friday and it was too late for him to get it done that week, i had to wait till monday. so i went 5 days with no ac. of course, it saved us thousands so it was worth it.
the moral of the story is, make sure you know someone trustworthy before your ac breaks. you don't want to be stuck dealing with someone like these guys. of course bob can charge way less than these guys. he's not spending a ton on advertising, in fact he doesn't advertise, he only need word of mouth. and he doesn't employ a bunch of shady sales people. well, to be honest, you can't blame the salesperson. i'm sure he has to be shady cause he works for a shady company."
280,"their ""guarantee"" is not honored. i am buying a house where they repaired the ac for a price tag of $3800 for the seller less than 6 months ago. it failed the home inspection and they will not honor their supposed guarantee by even looking at it. if you had honored your own guarantee you would have gained me as a customer, never mind the former owner. as is, i will find someone else to follow up on the ac and you lose a potential customer and presumably the former owner will not be happy to have spent $3800 for nothing but you can take that up with him. i will not be giving you a chance for my business in the future."
281,"these guys are absolutely useless.

i sent my samsung galaxy s8 in for repair because samsung canada told me to do so. they did not fix my issue and now samsung canada is telling me to send it to them again. if they couldn't diagnose the issue and fix it the first time, why would it be a great idea to send it to them again. this is just asking for failure.

do not go here. absolute trash."
282,"i used to be a fan but their new hours prevent me from using them.  additionally, they've been shrinking my clothes and when i pay them for repairs they don't get done at all let alone properly.  suffice to say, i'm searching for a new dry cleaner close to my home."
283,"i just called this company. the minute i said ""repair"" he said they do not work with broken glass and ended the call. i guess they only replace non-broken windows."
284,"dump the dump.  in 2015 i purchased a large, rather expensive, natuzzi sectional from the dump.  at the time, i expressed concerns about the stitching as it appeared it may come loose and ravel fairly easily.  it was already a little loose  in some areas.  the sales associate assured us that if we purchased the extended warranty that it would be covered and a non-issue should the problem arise.  he assured us that if it couldn't be repaired it would be replaced, per their policy.  so sure enough, 3 years later, the unraveling of the threading is at the point that it is in need of repair or replacement.  we contacted the third-party warranty company and filed our claim.  they don't make it easy.  completed paperwork on-line, took pictures, mailed everything in, they take their time reviewing/responding, only to find out that it isn't covered under warranty; repair or replacement.  why would i purchase a warranty for something specifically not covered by the warranty?  the dump, at this point, doesn't stand behind their word and i won't be returning."
285,"contract, mike davin, contracted as deckmasters built a deck for me in june of 2014. in august the bottom rail on the railing failed and i took a closer look at the rest of the deck. i had concerns and had a contractor come out to give me an opinion.  he brought the local code book with him and my deck was not built to code. the posts were not more than one foot in the ground with no more than 4 inches of concrete. the frame was constructed with single 2x10's, this is not to code. this was a free standing 14x14 deck. he realized it was not supportive enough (the deck bounced) and then tacked on these fake beams under the deck, they offered absolutely no support. the steps were not to code, there were two sets of steps, each containing 3 steps. they were all different heights and some surpassed the code at over 8"" high. for some odd reason he ripped one of the tread boards in half so the treads were not deep enough. this deck was dangerous. despite his ""forever deck"" ""lifetime guarantee"" on the workmanship on the deck, he did not even attempt to make the much needed repairs. we ended up in court in september of 2015 and i won a judgment. mike has not paid me. for your own sake, avoid this contractor. he is unscrupulous and takes absolutely no pride in his work, he's in it for the $$$$. beware!!"
286,we ordered coffee....nothing ever came to the table....the end. they were short staffed and needed help. place needs a renovation as well. i hope they turn things around.
287,make sure to read all documents closely before signing. if you receive a diagnostics and can not afford the repairs or choose not to have repairs done you will be charged $120. this was not verbally discussed whatsoever so as always make sure to read every.single.line.closely.
288,their furniture is overpriced and falls apart. when you call the warranty company they avoid you and hope that you give up on any repairs that they owe you.
289,"this company overcharges for repairs at an exorbitant amount.  we had our ac go out last summer and they conned my wife into joining a ""club"" membership, which turned out to be a total scam, as well as charging us over $2000 on parts which didn't cost that much.  and even on their free maintenance visits, they will tell you that something is broken and needs fixing right away.  unless you like to be pressured in your own home into buying things and upgrading equipment, i do not recommend this company.  i think each technician gets a commission on what they up-sell to each costumer.  this is not the way to do honest business.  run from these guys!"
290,i scheduled a time with puls they never came. i called and emailed to find out if they were coming. they couldn't find a repair tech to come. they asked if i could wait two days. after waiting they called to reschedule again.
291,"as casino's go, this isn't the most exciting or the most glamerous.  in fact, it is simply one of the average station casinos.  that said, the buffet is a great deal, they still have some old school slot games and i found $3.00 blackjack the other day.   if you want to make your money go farther, $3.00 blackjack is the way to go.  

like so many other casinos, you walk in and immediately smell like smoke for the rest of the day.  i can't last 1 hour in herear without my allergies acting up.
they still have some of the older slots and i won 30 dollars playing texas tea.

all your station rewards work here and it is usually less crowded than red rock!

for bargain value a 3 star but they need some renovations to get overall 3 stars.  still, if you want lower gambling limits and less crowds, this is the place to be."
292,crazy expensive!!!.  no attention to detail.  not trustworthy.  the on/off switch broke on my bosch dishwasher.  it was a 10 minute repair and cost $125.  they told me they would be the same day and gave me a 5 hour window.  the tech called at the end of that 5 hour window to say he would not be out that day because he didn't have the part.  when he showed up the next day the part he had didn't match.   all of the buttons on my dishwasher are black and he brought a white replacement button.  the tech also tried to sell me a cleaner called afresh for my dishwasher for $20.00 told me i could not get it commercially.  it's all over amazon for $5-8.00
293,"beware...mui rothwell has been ""managing"" our property for the last two years. she bluntly told us after many bad things had  happened that her only job is to collect the money.... any repairs that are needed is not her job, going to the house to make sure the house is clean after a tenant moves out, is not her job either. and how about this... any mistakes that her employees make is also not her responsibility!!!!

once, we got a $150 energy bill when the house was empty, bec she left the a/c on high, and had some off he wall excuse for it and took no responsibility for it... all out of our pocket for us!!!!

she also held onto $350 that the last tenant left us for repairs, but only remembered to tell us  3 months later and chalked it up to a  ""clerical error"".

in summary, if you hire her you' ll have nothing but trouble, headaches, bad tenants, broken home, and you'll get ripped off financially cuz  you'll have to get things fixed over and over again and have to pay for it over and over again."
294,"they are doing a renovation, so maybe they will redo the shower.   strange on off valve.   be prepared for alot of airplane noise, directly under the flight path."
295,the ac guys when they finally showed up botched the job!   so bad i had to hire my good ac company to fix their mistakes.  they left chunks in my line blocking ac plus didn't put a piece on right.  they cost me a lot of money to repair what they did wrong.   i wouldn't hire them if i were you!  these companies shoved down our throats by home warranty companies are the problem.   they make you suffer with no air conditioning for two weeks then they screw up the job!   pick your own company!  piece of mind is everything!
296,this place is terrible! the park smells and everywhere you walk there is pigeon and goose poop! the play area is in need of repair. i am shocked this park is in aliante!
297,this has been the most hassle i have ever had with any business! after 3 months of waiting on a horse trailer window to be replaced they still have not ordered the correct size. these people are idiots! seriously don't use them for repairs! disgusted!
298,they will always try to scam you with a nonexistent glass repair. spend your bucks somewhere honest instead.
299,"absolutely would not recommend this company. we had to go with this company for our shower repair due to our house warranty. first, they'll schedule an appointment and no one will show. we've had several instances in which no one showed or they came in later because it was more convenient for them. 

the company that contracts with them for the demo is absolutely horrible. this was our first demo we have had to go through and they did not seal anything off to contain the dust. to our surprise we found dust all over our bathroom area and into our bedroom when going to bed that evening. it was everywhere (on my son's crib, our bed, on the shutters, in the bathroom, just everywhere)! we stayed up until 1 am scrubbing our bedroom and bath clean and vacuuming. my daughter has asthma so i was angry. we bought and put up our own plastic drapes to contain the dust. 

also, they left a used razor blade somewhere in which my 11month old found! he went no where near the shower in the bathroom. thank god he is unharmed and my husband was there to take it away! i told george about it and he just brushed it under the rug.

we've had many different people come in to try and fix my shower. the first attempt i asked the workers to stop because the tile looked worse than the original problem. that's when george had to come in and reevaluate the demo and re install. this was a stressful experience and that is me putting it lightly. the communication that everyone has is non existent."
300,"""scammers"" is about all i can say about this company, or at least their employee ryan. (if i could give 0 stars i would!)  my furnace was blowing just cold air.  he came on 12/28/18 & said my compressor & capacitor needed replaced & the fan was making a lot of noise so he felt the shaft was broken.  he said cost of repairs would be close to total replacement so he recommended that.  (my system is 8 yrs old.)  he said the cost would be $9100 but if i signed that day he would give me a $2500 discount.  he refused to give me a written estimate also.  i pretty much escorted him to the door at that point.  called another contractor who came the next day, took photos of all needed repairs to show me in advance and gave me a complete estimate.   he said he would replace the capacitor & if that didn't resolve the issue he would remove it at no cost. once he opened everything up, the refrigerant was leaking of which he showed me a video of.  he then welded the leak & refilled the refrigerant.  all for less than $1300!  plus he said my system is good for a minimum of 10 additional years.  call george, not rescue one!"
301,the renovations are now impacting the quality of my ymca membership. there is no classes between 12:30 and 4 pm? what a joke!!!!!!!!! i'm about to cancel my membership. this is garbage
302,"horrible experience. he was hired by our warranty company to repair our dishwasher on 8/3. as of 8/13 he had not come to the house but said he ordered parts. i contacted him yesterday to find out status and he said he only has one of the two parts. i called my warranty company and told them of my status and they informed me that he just submitted the claim this morning (almost two weeks after he said he did it). when confronted, he folded and said i should get someone else out here. completely unprofessional."
303,"here are the facts. jj left me a voice message on july 1, telling me that my leather coat had been repaired. i didn't pick it up on time. i forgot about it. i waited until oct. 8 to pick it up, when i went to put it on and remembered where it was. but he had sold my $400 coat. i guess that's fair; i left it there for 3 months. but he could've called me a second time reminding me to pick up this coat. i think that it's worth a second voice message before you sell someone's stuff. 3 months is a long time, but it's not insane (especially given that it took more than a month to repair in the first place). and that coat got me; it was the type of jacket that you wear when you want to feel great. that was my coat that i loved and he sold it without taking a moment to call me a second time. the worst part is that i originally tried to pick it up when the ticket said, but he had not gotten to it and told me to wait another couple of weeks. it was summer, i didn't need it, that was fine. but then he sold my coat and didn't give me the courtesy of a reminder call. i'm devastated."
304,"golfed at old sycamore on 8/6/17. the course is a great layout and is challenging for all levels, but the greens were some of the poorest we have played on in the charlotte area. due to the greens, i don't believe it was worth the premium to play here. apparently they are aerating the greens on 8/8/17, but they will need much more than aeration as there are dead spots, they were very bumpy, and it's apparent that the membership doesn't take pride in their course as there were divots everywhere that weren't repaired. based on the greens, this course was a let down."
305,"home warranty sent them out and i swear they are i collusion. $180 to perform a 5 minute leak test to tell them where it's obviously leaking from. warranty didn't cover that and choice home warranty would not cover the repair because "" routine maintenance "" was problem?? scam artist"
306,"they renovated and now they have no seats!! why?  

where do i chill before i go to work? is this a new starbucks trend for yorkville? to have no seating?? boo!  not liking this renovation at all."
307,"in short i dislike two things from them. 1) repair company they use. 2) they lack sense of ownership. we need to keep track and keep reminding them.

i used this company to rent my home. i have with them more than an year. as long as there are no repairs at home this company works fine. but, if it needs repair they have only one company to go with. they don't provide second option. me being out of town. have to rely on them. but, they charge alot of money for small repairs. which i hated.

also when my home kept in the market, there were issues like, prospective tenants could not open the number lock."
308,"i cannot speak to their repair work. their est on a $1200 lens was $500. they suggested i send it to the manufacturer and i did. amazing that it turned out to be a free, under warranty repair.  i could never trust cris to provide an honest quote ever again. i'd always feel as though i over paid. beware."
309,"again, yelp needs to improve this app so that a negative review can be given.  how about adding pitch forks as an option for a negative review?
on 9/8/15, american home shield was finally able to get salego heating & air to return to my home to repair my ac.  the technician arrived and said he needed to get some information off our central a/c unit. he got the serial off my outside a/c unit, went up into my attic, was here no more than 18 minutes, said he had to order the part and left. today, 9/16/15, the representative at american home shield said the salego company has still not called them to give them a diagnosis or cost of the repair job. this is day #28 of having no air conditioning because of american home shield's and salego's lack of follow up and salego heating & ac's lack of concern for their customers. i rate both companies 5 pitch forks."
310,"if you like being charged lots of money for repairs that aren't needed, this place is for you! don't trust anything they tell you about extra repairs needed."
311,i've getting some work done on my 2018 jayco trailer and it's always me calling them for update.  they had me take the trailer home while waiting for warranty approval.  it's still me calling them to get updates.  i also want to get solar and other stuff added to the trailer but at this rate i don't want to give them any more money.   also what repairs they did first time around still need to be fixed. grrr.
312,i just called to ask if they could clean/repair my cuisinart coffee maker and before i could finish my sentence the guy interrupted me to rudely say no. i then asked if he could recommend anyone who could and again was rudely told no and then hung up on! if you can't take a minute to at least be pleasant if not helpful then i will be sure never to call again and also recommend others not call as well!
313,this place is a big ripoff they overcharge and up their parts to cover a the 3 year warranty that is already covered. they refuse  to honor their warranty. they are not reliable they get  you to sign up for finance then do repairs that werent even worth doing 2000 dollars later to say sorry you have a blown head gasket.
314,i recently moved in here and am very unhappy with the upkeep and maintenance in this place. some amenities that they offer such as a/c don't work properly laundry facilities are out of date and when i asked for a repair on the a/c unit they replaced it with a defective one. 3rd floor floor apts can reach 96 degrees and like i said a/c in multiple apts are defective and faulty and electrically outlets r not secured and just multiple issues with this place and am very disappointmented with the living conditions here! if i were looking for a place do not move here u will just end up unhappy with it as i am.
315,i had rescue air come out for an inspection of my working ac units. the technician that came out gave me a laundry list of repairs that were needed totaling about $1600.00. or he said he could sell me a maintenance plan for $1400.00. what a scam red lights and sirens were going off in my head. so i called another company for the same inspection. a company that i had used in the past for repairs. the tech informed me that there were no problems with anything related to my air conditioning system. i showed him the receipt from rescue air which had readings on it he showed me the readings on his meter as he checked my units. and surprise surprise the readings from rescue aire were all incorrect. i beleive rescue air tries to intimidate people into thinking their maintenance plans are the way to go and alot of people are paying for these plans when they are not needed. if you call this company get a second opinion it will save you thousands!
316,"very disappointed with this business.  we contacted them to make a conversion from lp to natural gas.  they came for an initial consult and informed us that repairs were needed, but tried to convince us that the repairs would only buy us a little time and we would be better off installing a new furnace.   when we insisted on the repairs they dragged their feet scheduling the job, to the point where we were dangerously close to running out of lp.  when i pressed to get the job scheduled, i was told to just buy more propane as they were busy and short-staffed.

i feel they were only interested in selling us a new furnace and when they realized we were not going to do so, they had no interest in completing the job."
317,i personally like the guys.  but they simply don't fix things well.  i've been there for years but over and over again they would fix everything but the problem i'm having or repair it poorly only to break a year later.
318,"nothing is ever good here. while i don't frequent bk, i wonder why i stop that 1 time each year. cold hamburgers made up sloppy and over salted cold fries have been the norm here. 

unfortunately, even with the renovation, it's just not worth the stop."
319,"read the other reviews and avoid like the plague .. would give zero stars if possible ..

bosch range repair. terrible experience and ripped off by this company. charged $80 and then ""gas tech"" spent 45 min trying to remove a stuck screw on the range. i agreed in advance of their fees as i was told it was a 10 min job. 50 minutes later he says he needs his superior to come and fix it with a ""special tool"" on another day. signed a contract saying the next visit would be no charge if no parts needed (i have the replacement part). 10 days later they finally return, same guy, no superior and say that they will charge me another $80 plus $30/10min, even though the contract i signed said there would be no extra charge. i refused to pay and they would not wait to speak to the manager. very shoddy.. out $$ with no fix. 

how are they still in business? .. oh right ..yeah."
320,this was my second trip to verbally grounded and i was not impressed.  i was interested in buying a hand lotion that was half empty and when i asked one of the workers (olga) if they had a full bottle in the in stock she advised me that the bottle of repair hand lotion comes half way full!!!!!  this is absurd especially being that it cost 13.98!!!!!!!.  so either the staff is not knowledgeable or they should be reported to rip off report.... either way they get 1 star from me today.
321,"giving a one-star review as we didn't end up going with this company due to the outrageous estimate received to install a kitchen sink/faucet, two bathroom faucets and some water valves.  the estimate we received was over $700 higher than the handyman we hired to complete the project.  keep in mind we had already purchased the sink/faucets from home depot so this would only be for any parts/labor.  do your research and obtain a few estimates before just accepting the first offer.  your wallet will thank you later."
322,this is one of the worst tim horton's i have ever been to. despite a renovation to update the appearance they still can't get your order right. almost half the time i go there they either give me the wrong item. tonight i ordered two teas at the drive thru and when i got home it turned out they were both coffee despite being labeled as tea. often this location is out of the item you want and take way too long to put your order together especially compared to many other tim horton's locations nearby. do yourself a favour and go somewhere else for whatever it was you wanted.
323,"they tore the house apart, took the built in microwave, cut wires. we had to pay for repairs to the house after they left."
324,"tuff shed says tuff s**t. 
if i could leave negative stars, i would.  i had high hopes and was very optimistic about my new shed.   the truth is, (and you will find evidence of this in many other reviews on social media), that tuff shed builds a sub quality product with scrap wood,  crooked walls, not suitable for drywall without extra work to repair and prep.  tuff shed uses scrap wood and when asked, the answer was that ""you should have received a contract that states what to expect"" 
i know, ultimately it's my fault for not reading the contract but i couldn't imagine that the contract stated they use scrap wood. my question is this.  if this piece of garbage is acceptable to them, then what else passes quality control that i didn't see?   i brought the issues that it's not square to the attention of the project manager and be said it was the fault of my contractor who doesn't know how to hang drywall.  again, you  will find evidence of this arrogance in other reviews.  
bottom line is this. if you're thinking of purchasing a tuff shed to use as anything other then storage for garden tools, unless you have the time to repair a big mess and you enjoy arrogant and condescending employees, you may want to reconsider your decision and go with another company."
325,"we called in september to get some broken tiles repaired. it's now december and the tiles are still not repaired.  where did all the time go you ask?  well the roof isn't leaking so it's not a priority, and it's a small job.  so it took weeks to get the estimate and then the scheduler thought it was done, but it wasnt, and then the guy showed up with the wrong tiles. just one thing after the other. they replaced our roof tile 3 years ago, and didn't seem so completely incompetent then."
326,this place is under  renovation if i would have known i would not have stayed here. my room sucked. half of the light bulbs were burnt out. just really bad overall.
327,"beware!!! what a bunch of scammers! i was sent a repair tech for my ac, it took 3 days to get him to come out, only to tell me my unit needed to have a leak fixed and add 8 pounds of refrigerant. my unit only holds 4 pounds! and at $105 per pound that would have been a huge loss in my part.  i found a reputable company to come out instead."
328,"update to last review 5 months  later the blower went out on our fairly new ac unit we purchased in may 2016 from this company for $8000.there is a heat advisory today, its 81 degrees in the house and im sure will only get hotter.repair guy tells me no way to get part to fix till monday.i have babies in the house......this company just keeps getting worst and worst! we have had issue after issue with this company.stay away!!!!!!!!
ac unit is only 13 months old.....
thanks for ruining our sunday"
329,"i wish i had checked yelp before i got this company to do work for me.  
the salesman displayed unprofessional body language right off the bat, made me uncomfortable.
they said they were coming on the 22nd.  i had company from out of town, and plans.  but we stayed in waiting for roofers.  they did not come to my house on the 22nd.
now my roof is leaking, got a couple other estimates.  both companies said i have new shingles up there, wrong color.  and not 900$ worth of work.  
i am having someone else repair my roof.
counting this a waste, just a loss."
330,"do not use this company. the repair man damaged my kitchen floor and denied everything. when i called a manager, they said there's nothing they would do. do not let this happen to you."
331,"warning this place is a total rip off this guy is unbelievably cheap and unable to repair amplifiers stay away from him you have been warned
next stop bbb they will be notified!!! people like this should not be in business"
332,"i recently called for a screw that had fallen off my drapery rod. i tried to replace it myself but the bracket that fell off did not match the other side. i couldn't figure out how to attach it since the sides didn't match. repairman came, and made repair. that cost me $75 for a little screw.  shame on you! never will call you again...adrienne o"
333,"water heater kept tripping breaker off. they went and said i would need a whole new water heater. i decide to wait.
i drive to phoenix (3 hour drive) to take a look at the water heater.
i notice the power connections are not connected properly. i still go ahead and check the heating element, thermostat and connections on the inside with multimeter (don't consider myself even a handyman so don't know the proper names).
i see nothing wrong, so i turn down the temperature to 120-125, and connect to power wires tightly...........water heater working like a champ! 
according to tenant, plumber only checked the power wires going to the water heater (which were loose when i arrived) and turned on/off the breaker.

sad, i was planning on keeping this company permanent for my houses. everyone makes mistakes, but this mistake could have cost me over $1200"
334,wow all i can say is br prepaired to wait. long lines with very few folks to check you in. i guess that why they are cheap amd u have to take two shuttles to get to them
335,i would never want to hire sears for any repairs. they relly did a number on my big microwave until it was beyond repair.
336,"had them come out to look at a 4x4 shower repair job (tile).  they ball-parked it @ around $1000 or so.  estimate they emailed was over $6000.   they said there was miscommunication and they'd get us a new estimate...that was over 2 months ago.    

i also had them come out and give me an estimate for a full kitchen remodel....i'm still waiting on that too."
337,"update: we finally received communication after leaving a negative review on the bbb website. this was our last ditch effort to get any form of communication. the maintenance team has changed and they admit they ""lost"" our repair requests even though we've been consistently emailing, calling, and leaving messages. smells like bs. still waiting for the parts to be delivered."
338,"i got scammed by using this company. i purchased a new unit through newacunit.com and was assigned a company to install it. when they came to install it they insisted i buy a $3,494 10 year maintenance and repair package and guaranteed i wouldn't spend another dime for 10 years. a few months later the company went out of business and now i'm out $3,500 because their installer scammed me."
339,"went to repair my eyes glass, the temple broke and the only option was given to me it was to replace it for $209.00 which is extremely very expensive, since he did not have the color he suggested to wait for a few days until the part will arrive. i decided to try my luck with another vendor who was able to repair it for $59.00 and not to replace it. i was a bit disappointed but felt lucky that it was repaired and i did not have to spend big $$$."
340,"our contractors liked working with the product saying they were easy to assemble & we are happy with the color and look.... but... we have been waiting for more than 2 months for missing pieces from our order which has proven costly for our renovation.  for many weeks the only answer we have been given is ""we don't know where they are & corporate won't give us the tracking number for us to look it up!""  seriously?  so in summary; good product when/if you are not on a timeline & you don't need all the cabinets you ordered & paid for. maybe order more than you need & pray you get enough to complete your project? ps: they give false dates and delivery promises which we believed the first 3 times because we were so full of hope!!!"
341,"my husband called them to check out our microwave that was acting funny. we needed four switches to repair. they told us he $85.00 for the house call to check it would go toward the repair of $220.00 if it was within 30 days of his first visit. we call them to repair the microwave within the 30 days. 

the repair man showed up without any parts to repair our microwave! now we have to wait for them to ""get"" the parts!

makes no sense to me.  sounds like a scam of some sort."
342,they repaired our flat roof three years ago and we had some leaks shortly after they did the work.  it was a fight to get them to come pack and fix the work again.  then this year we ended up with 7 new leaks from the work they did three years ago.  i would not use this company  to do a flat roof.  expensive and they don't do quality work.
343,i called mr. plumber to repair a leaky bathroom faucet.  plumber said faucet needed to be replaced.  there are 2 sinks in the bathroom and i needed to buy 2 sets so they would match.  the plumber went with me to the showroom and helped me select new faucets.  they were installed and i found leaking under the sink.  plumber came out at least 4 more times and leaking continued.  on each occasion we would set up appointment and later call to reschedule since he wasn't going to be in my area that day and didn' t want to come.  finally i asked for another plumber.  he found faucets were the wrong size for my sinks and water was leaking from around the top.  he said it could not be fixed and since i had chosen faucets they would not do anything about it even though their employee helped me pick faucets and installed them.  the faucets were $800 plus i paid for instsllation.  i filed a complaint with angie's list and mr. plumber refuses to do anything.
344,not friendly at all. i called to get a quote and he was very dry and on the category of repair he didn't include that he doesn't repair town homes. he told me he doesn't repair plumbing issues at town homes. don't call him
345,"based on previous reviews, my experience is no different. zach the estimator was nice and promised what was never delivered. i am so happy i checked yelp before signing on with them. if i could give them zero stars, i would.
stay away, far away, from this company if you want your repairs done quickly and with good quality."
346,wouldn't come out and fix my small plaster needing repair and then tried to quote me 600$ for something i fixed with quickcrete product for 50$!! dont be ripped off..stay away..ridiculous..
347,no call no show 6 times on a repair that was only to take 3-4 days.  it took 3 months.  even a project manager did no call no show 2x.  terrible company with no communication or work ethic.
348,repairs are highway robbery.  i had them install my gates for me 4 years ago.  i need the motor on my gate looked at as it is not functioning properly.  it is $250 to have them come look at it.  if there are parts...then i pay for parts (which is fair) but to have them come and install the parts is another $250 per hour! for one guy!  minimum of $500 + parts  for what is the equivalent of a garage door motor.  i'll never recommend them again.
349,"ten years ago we had them install a geo system in our new home. thought everything went well so we though. a leak developed inside the unit that was small and therefore went undetected for a long time. when we found it and called they sent a tech out who said that we didn't need that part operating and shut off the connection to our hot water tank.  then the corrosion caused from the leak started to cause fault codes and our electric bill skyrocketed. we ended up in a three way argument with sissler and waterfurnace and reached a settlement to have the furnace ""repaired"" all seemed okay but our electric bills are still ridiculous. also we found trash that the repair tech hid in our basement in boxes and under furniture. the waterfurnace has not been right since the leak. 
i was being generous with two stars."
350,"the new version of the jester is the mid-town gastro hub. they did a cheap second rate renovation and raised the prices. the place is still falling apart and dirty, especially the washrooms.
give this place a miss..."
351,jj's repaired our air unit's compressor and charged us $75 to haul the part away even though the freon was drained. in chandler you may take this part to the trash dump as long as it has been drained of freon. they argued that is was a liability to them but yet they could not come up with a reason it was a liability. this was an unnecessary charge that they have imposed. not all air conditioning companies impose this charge.
352,"i employed roger and his crew to fix my double doors at my place of employment! they were in bad shape and the job was more than expected however they did fix and rebuild our doors which over time had lost essential parts ( bad repairs by previous tenants) they did a great job on our doors and did what they said they would do- however in less than 30 days all the weather stripping was falling out - which i was told ""this is heavy industrial stuff, not that cheap crap you can buy at hd""well it sure looked the same. they did come out and fix that however when they fell out again a couple weeks later, and i called to have them fixed i received argument-excuses and verbatim pertaining to "" your doors are greasy, it's this heat want do you want me  to do? they maybe melted."" when i stated that my check didn't  melt before it cleared the bank i was rudely hung up on! nope i wont be recommending and i'm sure my one year warranty ain't worth squat either!"
353,fix your broken stuff man. you make enough money off booze to keep everything in good repair and then some.
354,"i had the worst experience of my life with the clearance center. i already did a trial with sleep number and went in looking for a replacement bed. i found an aireloom and they assured me that it was a floor model only and that is why it was a deal. after delivery, i started to smell a chemical smell and then when it wore off i realized that they sold me a used bed from someone that smoked in their bed. then, to make matters worse, after they delivered it i found out that they covered up a broken leg on the adjustable base that is not repairable.  since this is a ""floor model"" i cannot return the item and feel like i was completely misled and ripped off!  i have bought several items in my house from rc willey and have trusted their expertise, but now i am so frustrated and disappointed that i don't know if i will ever return."
355,this place is garbage super old and needs renovations throughout. the heat blows cold air and its just old and dingy. they should remove resort from the name. better of at a hampton inn that has new amenities and the heat works in the winter. they are dead wrong for these pointe resorts they all need full renovations. they just trying to milk their investment and shaft the guest with poor rooms and non maintenance facilities . don't stat here trust me you will be disappointed
356,"unlicensed and shoddy work.  hired because recommended by porch.com. met and seemed eager to work, he called and followed up with quote. hired for simple job. new dribbler system and inspect/repair sprinkler.  dribbler system doesn't work, sprinklers now working correctly. has promised to come by 2 times and has blown us off both times.

he appears to be a take the money and run type of individual"
357,"warning! do not use one guard home warranty.  they sent lee collins air conditioning out to repair my a/c and the contractor knocked down my closet racks and all my clothes while accessing a wire box behind them. instead of conducting an investigation,  they chose to listen to their contractor and not cover the repairs. i will be looking for a new home warranty company."
358,"closed!  and the big slides removed??

not sure what is going on here, looks to be some renovations i'll be totally bummed if they lose the big slides."
359,the name is fancier than the place. let's just say it looks like they did some renovation but not enough to really get it up to the level of more modern resorts.
360,"awful experience! they showed up over 1.5 hours late and we were told by one of the guys that he couldn't get his crew motivated. they dropped our safe down the stairs, damaging the stairs and the wall. they didn't have it strapped to the dolly! thank goodness no one was hurt. one guy was just rude and nasty to his coworkers and to us. they forgot to unload a table at our new house and when he delivered it the next day, stood there waiting for a tip! the company did send another guy due to late arrival and they covered the repairs, but i would not use this company again or recommend them based on our experience."
361,the renovations and new design have made this location slow and cumbersome and it frustrates customers.  even a simple order of a coffee and muffin has you waiting like cattle in a pen while some under paid and overworked kid struggles to keep up.  sometimes change is not for the better.  this one was not a good idea
362,"don't ever trust this company. my home warranty sent out this company to fix my washer. the repair guy didn't even repair it. all he did was ran the water and said there's no leaking. the fact that the towels were still wet under the washer due to leakage when he came, and even told him to load some clothes so he would see the problem. what he did was decline the loading. and even said he can't even diagnose or open the washer coz it was too heavy and he needed an extra guy. but he still closed the claim. so now that it's still leaking, the company said to call the home warranty coz the claim is already closed."
363,"they all do excellent work but if you don't have an appointment or you need 1 repair like i did, good luck getting seen. shouldn't have to wait 25 mins for 1 repair. that's why 2 star"
364,way too expensive !!!  wanted to charge $189 to diagnose a problem. .....post your rates on your website so we know to avoid calling your firm !!  .... i found a reasonable electrician and he repaired my problem.
365,"i have an expensive 370z, naturally i got the top warranty. or so they told me.
part broke  on conv. top, not covered in warr. no help from nissan. will cost over 10,000 to repair. 
they were very rude through the whole process. 
no love from me. it's toyota for me."
366,"eventually i had another company come hughes air heating & cooling from mesa, they found a problems with an expansion valve, several air leaks in the intake. in general the the repairman from hugh's repaired a lot of small issues before even attempting to diagnose and was able to make an accurate assessment about the condition of the unit. i decided to replace the unit rather then make the repairs due to the age and condition. 3 days later hughes replaced my unit with a new trane system in under 6 hours. everyone i talked to from hughes was professional, clean and took the time to accurately describe the problems with my unit.

degree, you just lost close to $10k in business."
367,"terrible quality work and ruined my repair work prior to painting. left lights loose, ruined my lock. rip off don't go here."
368,"we had a roof issue fixed along with an upper patio that had a been leaking below tile.  the roof so far seems ok but the patio was the issue,  repairs took a long time with little contact from the company on status and the quality of work was awful.  when we were told it was done there was a gap of where the tile was before and missing stucco as well as the rails were then missing paint at the bottom and attached crooked and one not attached onto the patio fully leaving a gap for water to get in.  in addition the new patio surface which was an painted on type surface was in blotches on my railings.  its an older home and they needed to be painted someday but this just made it worse.  the company said they would pay part  of railing painting and have a company come out but no one came out or called so we eventually took a slight amount off our bill in return so we would just deal with it because us having to follow up was getting beyond aggrivating.  the company did fix the stucco issues and had it painted, but that said the head contractor had no idea about how bad the work was his team did.  i was having to do the follow up.  i was here daily when they worked and it was always quick in and out.  now the surface itself i feel was not a product i would want now.  i feel it was a bad sell for them to suggest it and i wish we had done more research on it.  in the az heat anytime the sun is out our patio stinks a chemical smell.  it not as bad at night or a cloudy day but i have a patio i can't use when its sunny and it also stains easy if any pollen gets on it.  i am sure its waterproof and great for that but i have a patio i now can't enjoy when i used to be out on it every weekend.  i have called the company to get information on this surface and how long this smell will linger and i am still waiting on a return call and assuming i won't get one at this point.  buyer beware with this company."
369,the first time we used davis they were fine.  i think they may have been sold after that because the last time we used them they were pretty bad.  they broke several items and made the process to get repairs done impossible.  the lady there was very curt and obnoxious.  we had items in storage that were delivered uncovered and filthy.  i would not recommend them at all.
370,"if i could give 0 stars i would!  the plumber that came to my house was a thief! my kitchen faucet was leaking and the plumber said it couldn't be fixed (i later learned from the manufacturer that it could be repaired and any reputable plumber would know). my faucet retailed for $399, and i was told it was being replaced with a comparable faucet. what a joke! the faucet he installed was a hunk of junk! i found through research that my crappy replacement faucet retails for $69. this company employs thieves, do not use!"
371,worst place i've ever lived.  horrible maintenance and repair.  my place flooded out several times and i could never get anyone to fix it.
372,"these guys change diagnostics multiple times for the same repair, over charge, and don't fix the problems.. after thousands of dollars spent with them for different issues.  i have been financially harmed by their poor workmanship

on march 22nd, 2014 they replaced the egr valve and solenoid for 501.42.  it did not fix the egr system that later had to have the passage cleaned.  

the same day march 22nd, 2014  i was also charged 97.24 for the diagnostic, which i was charged twice. 

on august 31, 2013 they diagnosed the a/c system to not blow cold air due to low refrigerant.  i paid 204.13 to recharge the a/c and it did not fix the problem.

on april 29, 2014 you diagnosed the air conditioner not blowing cold air due to two schraeder valves and a/c seals that were leaking.  they repaired those parts, and recharged the system with refrigerant for 350.00.  it did not fix the problem

on may 13, 2014 they diagnosed the problem to be a hose that needed to be replaced to fix the a/c.  i paid 172.47 for the hose and the a/c still does not work.  (172.47 for a hose - can you believe it- and that was after arguing with them to cover the labor.  those hose alone cost 172.47 )

david is a liar, and will gouge you any chance he gets.  don't let him quote you any prices.  immediately ask for rudy."
373,"do not waste your money!!!! rip off!  paid nearly $200 for repair glass and home button, home button was stuck the very next day and they will not honor the 90 day warranty becuz the button was cracked.  they used a cheap part that broke when pushing on it.  less than 24 hours later they want to charge $89 to replace their bad job,  save your money, go somewhere else!"
374,"had 2 ac units on my roof having issues.  one unit the guys were able to fix and it's been fine ever since, after installing a hard start kit. 

other unit they gave me the ""bad compressor"", ""you just need a whole new unit"" song and dance, we can set you up for only five-thousand-dollars.  so i googled how to test the compressor, it was completely fine (apparently they never pulled the leads and checked it, this is something you can do in less than a minute with a multimeter).  turned out to be a bad fan motor, which was still under warranty and was a $0 repair.

so, one star for fixing one ac."
375,"requested basic light installation and fan repair
said he was not interested
obviously he is overrated as these are basic tasks which any journeyman could accomplish
not sure how he got his rating"
376,"tsa at this location is more screwed up than most. lines are abysmal, give yourself an extra hour on busy days. amenities are fair but nothing special. and it's under major renovation so looks like a bus terminal."
377,"was supposed to have a 10 am check in, show up at 12, still no room.  front desk staff disappeared for 15 minutes while a line to check in was formed.  finally get to room, smells, needs major renovation.  avoid"
378,"called an hour before he was supposed to be here.  left a message stating he couldn't make it and ""that was just the way it is.""  he also stated i could call him and reschedule.  guess he got a better offer.  who's working for who.  haven't yet had a good outcome from using a ""handyman.""  kan 'not' do what he says he kan."
379,"a neighbor recommended franks all about time and so i took him a wall clock which he fixed well and it worked fine.  i did take him an unreasonable amount of time to do the work though.
in october i brought him another clock.  this one had only hands that flopped around although the clock ran well.  about 3 weeks later, i received a call saying it was gonna' cost this much and he'd have it ready the week after thanksgiving.  bear in mind that he had from october to late november to inspect it, repair it, etc.  anyway, two and a half weeks after thanksgiving i called to find out when i could pick up the clock not having heard otherwise from him.  i was then told that although the clock hands probably needed replacement, he had gone into the clock works and now it doesn't work.  would need a complete overhaul  to the tune of 400$ and would take him 10 months to get around to starting repair.  
if you have a lot of time to wait and a lot of money to spend this is the place to go."
380,worst company ever for ac repairs!  don't keep scheduled appointments and scheduling takes forever!!!
381,maybe spend a little less time on your renovations and some more time on your staff.... very unorganized.
382,got hosed on a repair. make sure you call first and ask what the repair entails. i think these folks forget there are other people wanting your business
383,pho is way too salty and way too much msg. it used to be good but feel like it went downhill since their renovation. they do give you a lot but the quality isn't there in my opinion.
384,"this place offers a groupon, of which we purchased.  we drove all the way there, to find the door closed.  they are currently undergoing renovations.   unprofessional in my opinion.  why offer a groupon when you are currently closed.   it also says on yelp they are open.      i drove away so frustrated.  luckily we found this awesome place called ""kitchen 56.""   no regrets on this place, great apps and burgers.   don't go to arcadia tavern."
385,"wow, a new low. typical, it takes upwards of three weeks for a repair man to come fix their incredibly shoddy equipment, now the scam is to text you for an appointment date, then stand you up. if you receive a text from (702) 755-8819, know that this person will not show up at the appointed date and time. i too would also give zero stars if the option was available. recondition soviet equipment functions better ..."
386,i had high hopes for this new gym but they already have equipment pieces out of order. the equipment is not getting repaired and its approaching 3 weeks!  unacceptable for the over $40 fees they charge per month.
387,"i would go lower stars if possible, let me start with the fact that they do not charge for flat repair but once it's done the thugs that did the work strong arm you for $25 cash. good news is a dear friend is setting them up for a dying to be aired soon on local news"
388,"owners beware! read the contract, can't stress enough. they will tie up your real estate if you want to sell and charge you $1000s to buy out of their contract. my clients barely saw a return on their property and was charged for unnecessary repairs, plumbing jobs that did not exist and locked into an agreement they cannot withdraw from. terrible! no you do not get a live person when you call, just a recording and a place that will take your $. highway robbery!"
389,not cool! saw a link for $20 off for new customers. clicked and entered all my info (which they now have) only to find out that it does not apply to my repair. talk about false advertising! no where on any of the pages does it list any restrictions regarding the $20 off.
390,bar is shut down at it is like an abandon casino no one in the place. i know they were sold which is a good thing. need to close the door and start renovations.
391,"this business is not accredited by the bbb for failing to respond to complaints (not mine, but you can look it up yourself).  i hired them for some work which didn't solve the problem at all.  the owner then says, ""well the contract didn't call for us to do the kind of repair that is needed.""  i replied, ""you created the contract and described the work to be done and that it would be under warrantee.""  these guys are here to make money, and are not knowledgeable at drywalling or how to run a business."
392,i was originally very impressed with american furniture warehouse until i had a warranty issue.  i spoke with a local furniture repair facility that told me they have had many calls for furniture repair on items bought from american furniture.  makes you think about the quality of workmanship and the quality of the material.
393,i was so excited to try a new place that might have real new york style pizza. i get here and the place is either closed for renovations or it's just closed! it would be nice to have that information available on yelp
394,"i called sun energy when my a/c, purchased from them, broke down. i had a very small leak in the freon line. sun energy quoted, in writing, $838.00. i called a second company who repaired my a/c in just under an hour for a fraction of the sun energy quote. 
  
multiple quotes is the best way to separate the honest companies from the dishonest ones."
395,"just spent over 1000 dollars on exhaust system repairs they denied being an issue. if you are not local ( we are not ) beware!!!! 

refused to do couple other things while we were there because we got "" such a good deal!"""
396,"after being on hold for a total of 34 minutes i was told that it is ""normal"" for an oven fan to run for about an hour after being turned off.  this started suddenly after using the oven for 12 years.  one repair company fixed the ""normal"" problem which lasted for 4 months,  the second company ""fixed"" it on the first visit and on the recall claimed ""normal operation.  oneguard says there is nothing they can do (but cash the repair checks!).  oh-and in trying to cancel the warranty-the link i was given does not work.  apparently this can only be done by clicking their link  do not waste your money with this company!"
397,"place was horrible. i saw a movie here on a cold snowy night. the concession stand did not have one item that was hot. no coffee, no hot chocolate, no pizza, nothing. very dark and small lobby. you actually buy the tickets in a outter lobby that is two feet from the front door. every time someone walked in the cold came with them. the theatre which we saw the movie was dirty and many seats needed repaired."
398,"lived her for 5 months and would not recommend at all. there is never any parking so people make their own parking in the middle of the street. maintenance is terrible, i put in a request and two weeks later they still had not done anything about my request. i called the front office and they said they were behind. finally, someone comes out to do the maintenance and out of the 3 items i requested he fixed one of them, completely ignored one of them and the third one (which was to fix the front door lock) he does something to the garage door when i clearly stated it was the front door that i needed fixed. not to mention i currently have a maintance request and it has now been 3 weeks with no response. i had 2 items that needed repair and i wanted them to check windows and doors because wasp were getting in somehow. the front office guy tells me they ve been having trouble with wasps around the community. i assume that's a big deal but 3 weeks later, not a big deal to them. other problems with the location is you can hear everything your neighbors are doing and althought the place looks nice at first glance, after a few weeks you'll notice the place is old and needs some money put into it. overall i do not like this place can't wait to move out. next time will stick with what has worked in the past, mark taylor properties or a townhome rental."
399,"i just renewed my warranty for $725.00. i went to change my filter in my ac and it was dripping wet.  my policy states, the ac/heater unit is covered under the warranty. when i called oneguard the young man said. "" oh, we do not cover  blowing out condensation lines.""  if you go through us, you will be charged the $70.00 oneguard fee and pay privately to the company for blowing out your lines.  i said' well, that would be stupid of me, i'll just call someone myself'. which is what i did. cost of $125.00. my complaint is; i pay over $700 to cover, or thought my ac unit was covered, my home as listed on the list provided by oneguard including ac/heater. now, oneguard tells me. oh no we don't cover that.  have you all seen that warranty commercial about the zombie apocalypse?  that's oneguard.  i am sorry i renewed.  i might as well put that $700.00 in the bank and use it toward repairs, i have to pay additional anyway.  zombie apocalypse?"
400,"the  men's locker room is disgusting and run down. before you become a member do not let them tell you they did a renovation. it is more than 10 years old, dirty and broken."
401,don't know that i can classify this park as a good sam park. most units are old and what appear as permanent fixtures in disrepair and the preferred repair tool is duct tape.appears to be a poor working class park with most units in disrepair and surrounded with junk. good sam would not be happy with the appearance of this park.
402,"horrible place. located in one of the worst sections of phoenix, this extended stay ""motel"" is run-down and dirty. working in phoenix for five weeks, i checked into my room and promptly purchased a sleeping bag and pillow which i slept in on top of the sheets, after pulling the dirty, cigarette-burned bedspread off.

the shower head leaked badly, there were silverfish and roaches in the bathroom on a daily basis, and the bathroom door was separating...with the attempted repair being a line of staples running down the side.

mercifully, i found another place to stay and checked out of this dump after only one week."
403,this my second time leasing from them. first time i was new here and hence i failed to realize how a leasing company properly works. this is my second time and now i see how they have reached a new low. sometimes calling for repairs makes them abuse the caller by calling all the problems as non emergency. and i agree with what the negative reviews say here. they do take advantage
404,purchased hot tub in 2014. it had a crack one year later. had to pay to get it repaired. now the same crack reopened in 2019 and was charged again to get the same repair. it shouldn't have cracked to begin with and they apparently do not stand by their product or repairs. i've had hot tubs before and none have ever cracked.
405,"fraud company owned by a con man. forced a $1,000 repair i never asked for then threatened to sue me. year later a/c doesn't work and i need to hire someone else. knew this was going to happen."
406,"i am giving one star because after several attempts to reach and schedule a meeting with a ""jason"" i never received any follow up and my door is still in need of replacement/repair.  this experience gives ""the good"" phoenix contractors a bad name.
shame on you."
407,"first time of dealing with tesla instead of solar city  from my first encounter, i am not impressed.  our system stopped producing on june 10, but the first that they can get a technician out is june 24.  i asked about reimbursement for the electricity that we have to purchase from aps, which we had gotten when the inverter was being repaired previously, and was quoted regarding the power production guaranty and would not reassess until february of 2020.  i spoke with julian daniels at tesla.  he was not apologetic that the system was not working and was very 'cold' in his responses.  i asked for a copy of the performance guaranty which he sent me promptly, but his e-mail was very much condescending, using phrases like 'warmest regards' and 'hope you are having a great day'.  stay tuned, we will see what happens when the technician shows up on june 24."
408,"i'm shocked that anybody actually gives these guys more than one star. i asked for a small leak to be repaired outside my home .....it was a simple repair and he wanted $300 for it. i went to home depot and found the parts that i needed for $15 and did the repair myself.   i had him quote me on 2 other valves to be replaced and the total bill was over $900, oh brother."
409,"the two star review is mainly due to the park renovation. first off, why didn't they take into account the extreme hot weather? i assumed there would be some type of shaded tarp to keep the playground equipment from getting scalding hot. 
secondly, the design is horrible for young children. they made it a lot smaller, and harder for the kids to climb/play. 
lastly, only good thing to come out of the renovation is they covered the sand pit. we used to find trash or dog poop in there."
410,"do not use this company!!!!

they will over charge you for hours of labor, and then overcharge you for the cost of materials! they were sent in to repair a leak, they charged double the normal rate, and didnt even repair or even find the leak!!! had to have another company come find the leak after my below neighbors ceiling caved in!

what should normally have been $150 they charged $300 and then i had to pay a different company $500 to repair the real leak and repair my neighbors ceiling!"
411,"terrible company to rent from.  there was never a response to any work request i submitted.  i had water running from the ceiling and through the floors and were never repaired.

i still have not received my deposit more than 30 days after i vacated the properties after receiving assurance i would within two weeks.  my point of contact was uche."
412,i had contacted this company because of a plumbing issue. they sent me a plumber who replaced my sump pump--charged me over $1000. the work and parts were only under warranty for under 6 months. the pump is totally dead--i'm out $1000 for the first repair---and now have to pay another $1400 to have the pump replaced--again. i paid money to this company and trusted them to send me plumbers that knew what they were doing and not rip me off----  oh and the plumbing company--had bad ratings and complaints with the bbb. do not sign up--waste of money in more way then one..
413,"i was shocked when andrew handed me an estimate to update plumbing in my home.  i called benjamin franklin to repair a leak under my kitchen sink.  i was charged $69.00 for the estimate and then another $149.00 to perform the repair.  i asked the repairman how long it would take to perform the repair.  he said 10 minutes to do the work.  the part had to be ordered.  he asked if he could look at all our other plumbing in our home.  after looking at all our other bathrooms, water heater & water softner in our 2 year old home, he handed me an estimate for $2800.00 to update all my plumbing.  when i received the part, i called another plumbing company and had the repair done for $100.00.  the repairman said all my other plumbing was just fine.  wow, stay away from benjamin franklin plumbing unless you have money to burn."
414,"eh.  they took me in when no one else would have me but that is the end of my kudos.

roaches and stray cats dominate this complex which constantly shuts off your water to repair damaged water pipes.  guess what?  if the water pipes break that often you need to overhaul the system yesterday.  it doesn't matter if it puts the complex into debt the city should require the repairs to allow them to operate.

a campaign to feed anti-freeze to the cats would help build community."
415,"can i give negative stars? very disappointed with the complete lack of professionalism. we scheduled an appointment for repairs at my home today at 2:00. not only did they not show up, but they never even called, texted, or emailed me to say they could not make it. do not waste your time with this company!"
416,"this place is definitely not stay-cation worthy. i really wish i had read the reviews on yelp before booking but i looked up reviews through travelocity which are quite a bit different. my wife and i came here for a staycation and it's quite a bit different from how it is presented. firsts off it's quite a bit run down compared to the pictures. our room had 2 shades of paint from a poor paint job as well as stucco falling off the walls. it's in serious need of an update as i'm sure the floors haven't been redone in over 20 years. our bathroom was not the cleanest and the pictures of the room don't reflect what you really get for the price. we walked in and both felt like it was a dump. be prepared for tons of extra charges like parking, resort fees etc. the resort (if you can really call it that) was what drew us to this place. the pictures do not represent what it is really like. it is in disrepair. i'm not sure how hilton allows their name to be on this unless their standards have really dropped because i have been in budget motels that were nicer than this for a fraction of the price."
417,"absolutely awful.  i purchased a side table from thomasville but wasn't told they were going out of business.  the table was damaged so i asked that it be replaced but they said no, they would repair it.  i didn't want that so i called amex to dispute it and they reversed the charge.  when they realized the table could not be repaired, they agreed to give me a refund which i already had from amex.  they are terrible."
418,worked for drazen for one week. was extremely disorganized. worked 40 plus hours and was paid for 25...i was on time everyday and reliable. i am a college educated trades person and have never been shorted pay before. hence the negative review. i wouldn't recommend anyone work for bokor renovations
419,"stay away!!! place is a joke. they will pawn you off to some loser named john from a place called bare door. he will come by your house and give you an estimate then not return your calls. they originally did the doors at my condo and it was pathetic, half ass paint jobs and trim cracking within the first week. feel bad for any contractor who chooses these guys. might as well schedule a repair guy to come out immediately after their garbage work."
420,"called duquesne light warranty for ac repair--older system. tech comes out, inspects unit and says the repairs are in the area of $2,000, leaks in the system. calls warranty company for authorization and is denied because of coverage !!!!
   my neighbor who is a hvac guy comes and looks at the unit--up and running!!! ps. my neighbor didn't have to add any freon !"
421,"dont rent from this company unless u like being bent over and takin it dry. i rented from them for one year. they kept $600 of my deposit. for what? its unclear. good luck trying to communicate with them, too. you will get generic answers to serious questions. have a repair in you apt while your living their? prepare to pay out your hoohah. 0 stars isnt an option. heed every warning here, do not rent from this pathetic excuse of a company."
422,"scammers!!!  8 weeks ago ( yes, 8 weeks) my home warranty company assigned this poor excuse of a company ( how are they still in business), to come out to repair one of my ac units. this was on may 21st and today is july 22nd. they came out to inspect the unit, said my units needed to be thoroughly acid washed/cleaned which took about 45 minutes and i was charged $750. then over the next 8 weeks, they continually said that they were coming out with the correct part, and sometimes they did show up, but never with the part and so here we are 2 months with the ac unit still not operating. do not let these people into your home or to work on your unit as there is no telling what they are capable of. i am suing them for the $750 paid for the scammers "" acid wash"" as well as for damages. take a look at the other reviews (from the past week alone) and you will see a very troubling pattern of dishonesty, and deceit.  my next call/letter is to the bbb so that no one else has to be swindled by these losers, and then to the local television stations who expose these companies for what they are.  did i mention i have not had a working ac unit in part of my home for 8 weeks?"
423,"horrible. i've spent alot of money at conns.  i've been needing my recliner repaired, i spent 526 dollars on the repair plan for my couch set. i've been calling them since january only to have my repair request cases keep being closed for no reason, then having to open new ones, being danced around with and hung up on multiple times when the rep says ""one moment while i review your account"".  i will never ever buy from conns again, this place is a scam, they only want the sale and dont want to stand by their end of the contract."
424,"after i bought my home some repairs needed to be done on the roof.  my home inspector recommended these guys so i thought they were good.  well i have been in my house for 3 years and the exact repairs that these guys did are now in need if repair again!  they charged me 1200 for the repair.  well when i got another roofer who was well reviewed he came out and repaired the same spots for 600.  

keep looking don't use these guys their work isn't reliable."
425,i used premier for several years for snow removal. last season (18-19) the operator damaged the walk of my neighbor across the street. they are not even supposed to push snow across the street. john gilbride said he would pay the repairs but when i sent the receipts he stopped returning my calls and to date still hasn't paid. this is completely unprofessional and he did not keep his word.
426,"this contractor was hired through american home shield to inspect and repair a tub drain leak in my home. after stating that they knew what the problem was and that it was not covered by ahs, they performed the repair without my authorization and charged me over $500. this is unacceptable for a professional contractor and a formal complaint has been filed with ahs. do not let them come into your house!"
427,grossly overcharged for job. was quoted for repair or cold water leak that would require work from attic. turned out was leak at water softener and required rerouting of piping for about 20 feet. paid $2500 for what was maybe a $1000. job.  i developed a water leak 3 days before leaving town and listing the house for sale. shame on them taking advantage of a situation for which i was under time constraints. shame on me for not being more informed as to what was required. may be good for small jobs but be wary of anything more than
428,"called this company as my ac was not working. the  technician did come out right away as promised. he gave me a lot of double talk threw around a lot of numbers.   he explained that i needed a new ac unit because it was going to be obsolete in 2020 and it would have to be replaced.   he stated my compressor was about to go out and then  i would  have to replace it. 

he flipped the power switch after running some water on the unit. it started up. he had me signed for the repair. i am thinking that they were charging me the $99.00 i was quoted. turns out he charged me  for a capacitor. the air went out again in less than 30 days. called different companies for estimates. one company offer to check my system, no charge, before i spent over 8,000.00 for a new system. turns out it was the capacitor which the replaced. when i called elite air i was told the tech said i needed a new capacitor and he did not replace it. it was all a scheme to get me to buy a new ac unit. i definitely will not be calling them if i need to replace my unit.   learned a hood lesson always get a 2nd opinion."
429,"i recently purchased a new home. it did not pass inspection because the furnace was not working. the original homeowner called a company to come fix it. it then passed inspection and i purchased the home. 2 weeks later i called goettl air to come do a tune up on my unit since it is an older home and i wanted to make sure it would make it though the summer. the tech that came out was very friendly. he took a look at my furnace and said whatever company fixed it did a ""mickey mouse"" job and left it as a fire hazard. there was a large crack in it that was unrepairable and he told me i needed a whole new unit. another tech from goettl came out to give me pricing on a new unit. i picked the middle option and it was over $15,000. mind you, my home is 1200 sq ft. as a brand new homeowner i found it necessary to get a second quote to make sure this price was in the ball park. the next day a different ac company inspected my unit. they agreed the furnace was poorly fixed and whoever did it knew it would not last. at this point i requested the invoice from my realtor to find out who did this extremely poor work. you can imagine my surprise when i found out it was goettl ac that did the original repair. i was sold initially on their ""good ol boy"" advertising and ""we do it right, not cheap"" standards. clearly that is not the case because whoever fixed this furnace should have told the original owner, like i was told, that it needed to be replaced. instead, they decided to do shoddy work to just get it to turn on which would make it pass and now, as a brand new homeowner i am stuck with the costs of installing a brand new unit when it never should have passed in the first place. of course, after learning this info i did not go with goettl to install a new unit. i went with a different company in town, that had a better warranty and also was half the price. i would not recommend using goettl for any hvac repairs/installs. this experience showed me that their advertising is false and they do poor work just to get by. and to top it all off, at the first visit they still charged me $80 for the tune up and no tune up happened. i was just informed i needed a new unit. complete unprofessional bogus."
430,"so they come off seeming like an honest  family oriented company. wow don't be fooled, get a second opinion no questions asked. 89$ saved me 12,000. so i signed up for the yearly maintenance program at about 300. told the lady i wasn't sure how well my upstairs unit was working.(have three different units for the house). was told they'd have to check it before i could start that so i scheduled the appt. the tech came and told me the compressor was bad and it was about 3500 to fix or maybe just replace it since they are doing away with r22. said i wasn't sure so he said he'd have a salesman get ahold of me. first he had to go take pictures of the gauges to give to him and he'd also confirm at the appointment with his own equipment. salesman shows up and basically says they won't repair the compressor because of the r22. and replacing the unit will pay for itself in monthly savings. they have 3 different units ranging from 8000, 10000 or 12,000. i opt for the best one. told a friend about it and he told me he'd get a second opinion and recommended someone. i was like no these people are honest, they're all over the radio and on billboards. i trust them. day before scheduled install i get cold feet and ask for his buddy's number. luckily he came by that afternoon and checked the unit. absolutely nothing wrong with it. one of my other units was low on freon. the reason the upstairs unit didn't seem to be doing its job was that it was trying to do the job of both. he told me he doesn't talk crap about anyone but goettl is the worst. so spend the extra for a second opinion and don't start with goettl."
431,"my wife and and i have been members of this facility for 15 years.   i can't understand why it takes so long to repair equipment when it goes down.  currently, there are at least 4 pieces of equipment that haven't been operational for 2-3 weeks!  the facility is not very clean.  i never see any attendants wiping down equipment or vacuuming.  men's locker room is dark and dingy.  this facility needs a major upgrade.  it does not reflect properly on the upscale neighborhood where it is located."
432,"update:  the deal got done in the end.  literally at the last moment. there were even more frustrations and aggravations and even on the very last day, at the very last moment, it looked like it wasn't going to go through.
beware, beware, beware.  i have bought and sold several (more than 10) houses in my life and this was hands-down the worst experience of my business life.
after the closing, i have discovered that many of the things that were supposed to be repaired by the seller were done marginally, or incorrectly.  turns out that the north &co. realtor was the one that hired the incompetent person that ""did the work.""
finally, they keep contacting me to remove this review!
if i were you, i would run away at the mention of north &co."
433,"called these folks two weeks ago for air conditioner repair.  two weeks.  they said they would come that evening but couldn't guarantee a time.  well, needless to say, no one showed up.  nor the next night, after i called and asked about it.  and i saw their truck at my neighbors house!!  i thought at the time, great - they'll kill two birds with one stone!  but no.....so - two weeks later and i never heard from anyone again.  funniest thing about this - when i called they thanked me for the opportunity since i had never used them before.  i would give zero stars if i could."
434,"our home was built in 2012. i have been with oneguard for three years and this is the last one. not only do they increase their deductible and cost, but they also slowly decrease their coverage. do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on them!!!!!!!! they could have done the right thing and honored their contract and repaired the air conditioner but instead they manage half way through the process to forward a considerable cost on to us as the consumer while using their contractor. what a waste of time and money!"
435,had jack the roofer do my roof have had leaks call for repairs after 3 months still no response. a couple more rains and still no response. so much for a ten year warranty must not mean to much to them.
436,company does a good job w/power to the house- but has been unable to properly repair a street light next to our house in seven eagles in 28 months. off and on ever minute. worked for three months then off and on again
437,"i scheduled them via my home warranty company, old republic, to repair my oven. they scheduled me a week out...okay...and then the morning they were due to come they texted me saying ""the tech"" had a family emergency and can't make it until friday. life happens, i get it. but you have a company to run. get more techs! 

what i don't understand is that this company clearly has issues and a poor reputation--why are the home warranty companies using them?!"
438,"installation went well but you'd better hope nobody needs to come out to make repairs or adjustments.   my elderly parents can't get the water hot enough, and they have been waiting almost 2 weeks to get this repaired.   bath fitter couldn't fix it last thursday when they came out (said they needed a part), and last friday when they were supposed to show, they didn't.   nobody even called to tell us they weren't coming!  told us we'd have to wait until after the holiday weekend.  for an $11,000 shower, this is not acceptable at all."
439,"i called these people for one of their rejuvenation appointments, the tried to push me into some type of membership that i had to pay in advance, i finally convinced him i wasn't interested, i just wanted an appointment only.

of course on the day of the appointment, they call me because they are running late, doing some repair job. 

for me, that's all i need to know, if you can't make an appointment that i set aside my time for, i'll call someone else!

i don't have any time to waste on companies like this."
440,"stay away!!! place is a joke. they will pawn you off to some loser named john from a place called bare door. he will come by your house and give you an estimate then not return your calls. they originally did the doors at my condo and it was pathetic, half ass paint jobs and trim cracking within the first week. feel bad for any contractor who chooses these guys. might as well schedule a repair guy to come out immediately after their garbage work. i'm sure their competitors love them because their shitty work makes them look so good."
441,"this company did roof repairs for the seller of the home we recently bought.  the receipt clearly states a transferrable, 2 yr warranty.  we have contacted this company several times to fix a leak that they supposedly repaired for the seller.  all we get is the run-around.  don't take a chance on this company!!"
442,"this review is based solely off the new playground. 
the rest of the park is as beautiful as it has always been  and my review only reflects my new found opinion of the  playground in light of the renovations that took place last year.

being as i just had a baby (who at this time is now only 8 months old) i was excited to some day take her to the park that i played at so many times as a child. 

however, after the remodel the playground is for all intensive purposes, dan-ger-ous! definitely not a place to go down a slide with your little one or even walk him or her up.. being as you have to climb up the ropes. in the past there were stairs, multiple big kid slides and some small baby slides. it was the perfect little park. 
not any more!! 

oh and the saddest renovation has to be that they took out the big swings and now some smaller, more child friendly swings, lie in their wake. i mean, to be fair, the old swings were pretty tall but i fell off those swings plenty of times and didn't break anything! i'm guessing i was just one of the lucky ones. 

maybe i'm just feeling nostalgic but i literally cried a few tears when i saw the swings were gone. so many memories as a toddler, child, teenager and adult were made on that swing set. 

shame on you pueblo park!"
443,didn't find many major problems with house. cost thousands in repairs upon getting keys.
444,"came out to give estimate on a few small repairs.  i didn't get an estimate, said he needed to talk to the boss, so he left.  it's over 24 hours later and no response.  i called another company 90 minutes ago, they came out within 30 minutes and had all four repairs done in an hour. update: tiffany at the company thinks this is funny, lovely business model."
445,the guy came out removed the bees for 495. he told me they were africanized and that the outside was clear but he would have to remove the bricks to kill the additional bees that were more than likely in there too. i asked was that part of the 495.00 you are charging now?!? he said no the labor to remove the bricks is additionally 995.00! and the kicker? i would have to hire someone to repair the bricks removed .. don't use them or you will pay a whole lot!
446,i had my roof repaired by gryphon in 2012 and it started to leak in the last rainstorm 3 weeks ago.  call them out to look at the damage and the estimator john hammond says it would cost around $1800 to fix.  i had 2 other roofing contractors come out as a roof should not leak after only 6 years.  they both said that the roof leaked due to poor workmanship on the part of gryphon roofing.  i am contacting the better business bureau and the registrar of contractors.  the thing is very upsetting as the gryphon estimator could see the poor job they did and should have owned up to it.  i would not recommend a company that doesn't honor their work.
447,"this review is based solely on communication and not their actual work. the gentlemen (very nice) came out to look at the repairs i wanted done in my home. they emailed me the plans, costs and everything.  i wanted to use them and felt very comfortable with them. then after many attempts to book them, they said they could not do the project until about a month and a half later due to a busy schedule. i said that was fine and i would wait. so i waited and waited and have sent them many messages and got no response. so the work on my home was not completed and now i have to start looking for someone else to do the work. very poor communication. i get that you're busy, but if you say you can book me in february, then keep your word. here it is now, february, and i get no response."
448,"just spent over 1000 dollars on exhaust system repairs they denied being an issue. if you are not local ( we are not ) beware!!!! 

refused to do couple other things while we were there because we got "" such a good

was never offered extended warranty.  let it go johnny, you keep making excuses that are not realistic..."
449,"while the renovation has prettied up the place, i would have rather seen the money go to purchasing books and media. the selection of dvds is good, but not great. 

but my major issue is that the book selection is horrible. for a building this large, why do they have a third of the books most other libraries have? why are the bookshelves themselves so small? someone seriously dropped the ball here."
450,"this is a nice bar with horrible some, not all cranky outdated staff. one guy a very old ex-stripper with attitude from florida (someone needs to tell him he is a ""has been"") is extremely moody and needs to go. he snubs people he doesn't like. he is a bartender, he is a part of your evening out, and he disrespects you, imagine that! woody's spends a lot of money on trying to keep this place relevant and current and they do a good job and then their antique staff ruin the party. if you are not a part of the staff ""click"" you may as well go somewhere else. next time they do some renovations they need to toss out some of the staff."
451,"guy came out, went up on roof, came down and showed me pictures of what i know was someone else's roof. he explained that a portion of roof needed to be replaced because so many shingles were missing in the pictures (the pictures that he said was my roof but was not). he said he would  email an estimate. i told him i was having other contractors come and also let me know what they thought. at that, he said goodbye, took his ladder, went home, and i never heard from him. 
another company came out. they said my roof was in good shape. showed me actual pictures of what i know to be my roof. they made the repair and all was good. stay way from these guys."
452,yelp had a check in coupon for a deal on the batting cages. showed up and the batting cages are broken and have been for a long time. said they would be repaired next season. why offer a promotion if you can't fulfill it.
453,"what they don't tell you is your furniture will not be perfect. your furniture will have flaws in workmanship when it's delivered. 
two couches and both needed repair. 

workman came and repaired the one couch and other couch was to be replaced. when they came to replace couch it had more visible defects than first couch. 

i was told that if they replaced 2nd couch hoping for better workmanship it had flaws i would be forced to select other merchandise and model. 

if i was to go to warehouse to inspect next couch i would be forced to transport the couch home myself. 

you get what you pay for. it's a good deal at afw for a reason. good luck  and keep expectations low."
454,spent time in charlotte traffic to visit this location for repairs. a handwritten sign posted to the closed gates of the location simply said we will be closed for the remainder of the day and will reopen tomorrow. really?
455,"very odd place. it may be spirit filled, but not with the holy spirit....other demon spirits perhaps. we find it horrifying that their logo is an upside down crown! totally creepy! jesus christ has not been dethroned as implied here. i don't know if they ever fixed it, but where the children's church is, that side of the building was in bad disrepair & ready to collapse. i do not recommend this place to anyone."
456,not happy at all with my brake job. should have gone to asia repair. cheaper and better quality parts.
457,"i dropped off a pair of harley davidson riding boots ($120) for a repair.  when i came to pick them up, they told me that my father already picked them up.  not true.  my father is 88, and never leaves his zip code, which happens to be over 500 miles away!!!!!  

next they claimed i was trying to scam them, or perhaps someone else pulled a fast one, etc.  several months later, no boots, no compensation, only denials, and finger-pointing.  as for the repair,,,,,,,, not sure what to say about that."
458,i was very disappointed with the work performed by santom. i left a table with them for 2 months and it was not finished when promised or repaired as promised. the cost for refinishing the top of the table was outrageous at 454.00.do not use these people unless you want incomplete work at a very unfair cost. beth c
459,i absolutely do not recommend this company! we purchased an extended warranty & never needed it until this week. the representative was not helpful & denied the claim because we were over by 1600 miles. they refused to extend the warranty or offer any type of discount. we paid $2400 for the warranty & the repairs they denied were less than $1500. do not give them your money!
460,"if i could give this company les one star i would 

from the time that they start managing my properties i saw nothing but 

dishonesty repair charged triple times more than the real cost if you have pr

if you have property and you want to rent it out don't use this company it's 

nothing but disappointment 

your tenant pays the rent but getting money from this company is pulling the 

tooth may even harder 

stay away from this company  i rather have my properties stay wakened 

than handled by this company . bad news


today is 12/09/2103

look like the owner of the company made it right so far so good."
461,"stay away from this business. will be late with your repair with a bunch of excuses. plus if they're late, they will promise to pay for you rental but will not. you've been warned."
462,"i have never written a review before but i am very disappointed in this company.  my husband installed a hot/cold water valve in the middle bathroom.
unfortuneately he installed it upside down.  he called dish to repair it (i use  this term
lightly) it worked but in reverse.  they sent out a plumber who fixed it. remember it
was upside down.  he charged for the visit and we paid him.  the bathtub faucet
dripped hot water.  we called and they sent out another plumber he fixed it quickly.
mind you this was their work. they charged us for two visits."
463,brought a vintage kenwood amp here on two separate occasions where they claimed they fixed the problem each time.  frustrated we found another business that fixed the amp on their first try and said godar did not change any of the interior components.  stay away from this company fir repairs.
464,"gucci was the worst barber i've ever had. he chopped off my sideburns without asking and to try and repair it, he proceeded to give me the worst fade i've ever seen. looks like a lawn mower went loose on the sides of my head."
465,very disappointed with this place. purchased a small drone for my daughter which broke in 1st 10 mins of use. told can't return or repair. waste of $$. avoid them.
466,tried going bowling here... showed up once and they were closed for renovations... showed up the second time and they had a party going on. did not get to bowl.
467,"disappointed in this long-standing madison business.  i recently emailed them from afar about getting a clock, bought from them in the 70's, repaired.  they showed absolutely no interest in the fact that i had this piece of history, nor in helping me.  pretty much just blew me off with no suggestions."
468,"jackie, i did inform you guys. i brought it in, they fixed what was slipping, and said that was not part of the work that they did. the repair lasted for tow- three days then the same thing started to happen again, the same reason why i brought it in to you folks in the first place."
469,our couches are only two years old and i've already had to have them come out and repair them twice because they keep falling apart. thank god we bought the extra coverage. worst 2000 ever spent
470,"unprofessional, and not helpful.  he charged me $60 to take one look at my washer and tell me it wasn't repairable."
471,just went up here to see the cost of a diagnostic for my o2 they wanted $70. i called two other places who wanted $49. if they were going to overcharge me $20 for a diagnostic i wonder what they overcharge for the actual repair...
472,"a bunch of thieves... the morning of checkout, i slipped in the bathroom, and caught myself on the wall, which broke the cover to the light switch (no big deal i thought). i picked up the pieces, and threw it away. didn't even bother mentioning it at checkout, as it was a simple fix. 4 days later i check my bank account... $430 charge for the repair!!! i called up and asked how in the hell it cost that much, as i am a construction worker myself, and know for a fact that it wouldn't cost even $100 to fix. all the condescending guy on the other line kept saying is ""that's what we charge."" and when i asked for a receipt of the work, he said ""no that is not out policy."" complete sham. i am all for paying to fix what i broke, but $430 to fix a broken light switch plate is beyond outrageous."
473,"great location, looks good from the outside but is a bit dated inside and could use renovations. they charge you an extra $15 a night which covers internet but they don't even have wireless. also both my wife and i ended up with bug bites so i'm thinking bed bugs and on checking out i told the front desk and they said they would check it out and call me. they did call later and naturally they said it was clean.. so who knows maybe we got bitten some other place but sure seems suspect."
474,went to see david last night at 9:30 show was slow and lacked energy. it seems david is past his prime and his best trick of the night was swindling me out of $200 for me and my wife to attend. honestly the lady next to me fell asleep 10min into it. the hall needs renovations and so does the illusions. save your money see something else
475,"the construction going on outside was a huge inconvenience and was not notified of it prior to arriving or else i would've stayed somewhere else. it woke me up in the mornings, there were areas i was not able to walk outside, even got yelled at by construction workers for walking somewhere i wasn't supposed to that was not blocked off just trying to walk out to the strip. i stayed here because it was one of the cheaper places but it still wasn't worth it. at least not until they finish the renovation outside. the rooms are nothing special inside either, no mini fridge which is a big negative."
476,this place was at least ok-- until the renovations.. now it just sucks.. i wouldn't go here at all for any reason at this point.. the new setup is all for taking your cash easier.. it's too bad.. i used to like this place.. they will no longer be getting my cash..
477,"newly remodeled mcdonald's - exciting, right? sadly, no. this location (closest to my home) has been closed down for a week or so, but now open so i decided to stop in to check out the new renovations and ordered my fav double cheeseburger and large fry. the fries in the bag were cold! the burger old and tepid at best. i had high hopes for the renovations. new look, same old disappointment :("
478,"rude and expensive and repair done very poorly that sums
up my experience at this establishment. i would rather attempt
the repair myself than ever go here again."
479,"explained the problem i was having with the granite in my shower. requested for him to provide a free estimate. he basically refused to even come out and take a look to provide a visual estimate.  

came off as very rude and unprofessional . find another company to handle your tile/granite repairs."
480,does not notify of some issues.  does repairs without prior authorization. charges ourtagous amounts for chemicals that should not even be using that much if it was properly maintained. overall used to be good but gone downhill in the last 2 years.
481,"if you'd like to have the technician you call out to your home repair your unit, do not call this place. instead of fixing the problem my husband called them out to fix, the tech went looking for other issues, kept trying to sell me a new unit and treated me like an ignorant house wife. this is the second time they have been out through our home warranty company and the second time they failed to fix the issue, instead found something else we would have to pay them to repair, maintenance not covered under the warranty. they tied it up so we have to have certain ""maintenance"" issues resolved through them before the home warranty can be effective. avoid at all costs!!"
482,"pre-renovation i would say this place was one of the best. after the renovation this place have become one of the most disappointing places i have eaten pho at.

sold out completely and changed recipes for the absolute worst. people go there because it looks trendy. unfortunately the pho is horrible."
483,standard bk.  but be prepaired it is located in the main bus terminal.
484,"i contracted frank fritz because i thought he was a good person to deal with but resulted being the opposite!  he never, ever returns calls, he ordered a part for me and took longer than what he said it would be.  he did the repair but a week later the washer broke down and i have been calling him numerous of times and had not returned my call.  his number now is 602-377-3977.  do not do business with this person, horrible way to run his business."
485,"overly crowded and not that big. maintenance is also an issue, especially with the spin equipment. and the men's bathroom and showers are disgusting. they need a total renovation. the showers smell perpetually like urine for the past year. they acknowledge the problem but have done nothing to fix it. 

parking is almost non existent now as well. 

i am now seriously thinking about changing gyms."
486,"i am waiting now for about 4 hours- i made the appointment from 8 am to 12 pm......i have an appointment that i cannot miss at 1:30 out of the home, so this is upsetting the reason for the home repair is the new control panel placed in my dryer one week ago is dysfunctional, i bought the home warranty- i can see like all warranties it means nothing."
487,"never again !! stay away!! lesson learned

see my full review on tripadvisor dot com

rented 2 rzr for the weekend. 1 broke down within 4 hours of riding. i got no credit for the second day + was charged $600 repair bill. due to rental contract, they have you over the barrel on this. no actual proof was provided to show it was driver cause for the break down. it was just beat up equipment and i was the lucky one to get stuck with the repair bill.

look out for a story for this on ""3 on your side"""
488,they don't open when they say they do despite hours posted on the website and building. i arrived expecting them to be open at 8 and the doors remained locked despite after 8am. workers were walking around in the repair area and apparently i was invisible so i left!
489,"cracked granite on install, never repaired. this is shoddy workmanship and disorganized cluelessness"
490,"funny how at home depot, warranties and personnel, aren't what they say they are. for starters i bought an extended warranty from the for a washer and dryer combo. 1 year download the dryer failed and the warranty is useless in aiding in a smooth repair transaction. im still out $125 for the repair (which i was told was gonna be reimbursed) thanks home depot for the warranty . secondly i've been contacted and scheduled to have someone fixed my wraught iron door and 8 months have passed with no shows. again, excellent job home depot. photos soon to come."
491,"when it takes a business over a year to respond to a review, and then claims that the events that transpired over my interactions with them were ""misleading and false"" you know that they're full of shit.

the attitude they display in the responses they finally decided to bequeath upon yelp is pretty telling as to how they do business. b&b's repair side of the business is horrible, a waste of time, and is the most disrespectful business i've dealt with in phoenix!

go anywhere else."
492,"a b-list casino trying to be a-list, without doing anything to be viewed as a-list. 

my first time here was the other day, and i found that the staff were clueless, and unhelpful. i asked someone where i could find an atm and he looked me dead in the eyes, shrugged, and walked away. restrooms were dirty, and needed some serious updating/repairs. locks on the bathroom doors didn't work, garbage all over the floor, dirty smeared mirrors, and the inside of the stalls were so incredibly dirty and gross i actually gagged. after walking into the facilities and refusing to use them, we promptly left.

i don't know if it was just an off night, or if this casino is always like this, but my first impression wasn't very good."
493,i noticed dirt or soot along the ceiling. needs some renovation. also concerning is the very long narrow staircases with multiple levels. safety concerns. needs upgrade for handicap acessiblility
494,i have always loved this bank... until now. opened a homeowners claim for a downed fence. after the run around regarding the repairs now we can't get an answer on the claim since they are busy. two weeks and counting meanwhile i have a fence propped up and i'm still paying the premium.
495,this paradise bakery location was permanently closed june 12 and will reopen june 29 as panera bread after renovation is complete.
496,outsourcedata says they will repair your hard drive for $60 on their website but after sending in my wd hard drive they wanted to charge me $1140 to recover 300 gb of data. this website is a complete waste of time and money.
497,"i should have listened to the reviewer from 11/1/2010 but i figured it must be ran differently a year later, nope. they gave me an estimate for close to $364. i got a second opinion thankfully and i was really only looking at $188. i will not be returning because they wanted to charge me for unnecessary repairs."
498,"dont let this co., desert realty, manage or sell anything for you. dont know 
about finding a rental thru them, but i think the reviews speak for themselves. 
they will drain every cent from you if allowed, and turn your investment into a 
horrific nightmare. very dissappointing, stressful, to work with. heartless. if 
you are unfortunate enough to get stuck with these people, you will be sorry. 
managing property never found good renters, and always found many fix ups 
between with overblown repair tags. selling property just the same. many high 
repair tags to get home in sellable condition. after visiting, some repairs not 
even made or done very poorly. everyone passes blame to eachother."
499,let's start by saying its old!  the sheets are ruff and so are the towels. though it is clean. needs serious renovations.  close to transportation and walking distance from restaurants and bars. not much more.
500,"i called this company to fix my water heater because there was a sticker on the unit saying to call for warranty repairs. the thermostat had to be replaced and was told that i would only have to pay for labor. apparently the labor for 2 hours was over $350! i never received an invoice and called the company to discuss the excessive price and the discrepancy in labor time. the repair only took an hour so i did not understand why i was being charged for 2. i was told that the part was not on the truck so he had to drive to get it and wait in line, both of which i had to pay for! the manager i spoke to was extremely rude from the moment i called. he was finally willing to drop the price $50 after i called for the third time. i will never use this company again. i never received a written estimate, receipt, or invoice of any kind, despite being told the manager would email it to me."
501,they didnt like the fact that i double checked my coverage with my homewarranty company when they gave me an estimate on how much the repairs was going to come out to.. so they left with out completing the job.
502,"they're a bunch of crooks. stay away. i bought a camper, was told by the sales lies about it's capability. they then would not correct the error. i ended up losing 8 k selling that camper. i've since purchased 4 new campers for my side biz. they lost out on potential sales and repairs as i used to stop there and have my campers repaired there. stay clear. so many other honest trades out there in mesa, no need to go to ldlp."
503,they came out on a home warranty call and said the repair was not covered so we paid out of pocket to install a pressure regulator and they installed it in the wrong spot so the pressure to the washer and irrigation is not regulated.  they then have not returned any of my calls over the past 3 days.
504,"i have been a regular there for a few months now ,the staff is great . jenny is a great bartender. but beware of the owner.. he's a bit of a dick , ( quick to over talk & not listen,to anything said ) once he's had too many.. when it's just the staff, over all... it's a great time . ne renovations enhance the  cozy atmosphere ."
505,"the concept was really cool, and none of us had been to an escape room before... we did ""return of nemesis"" and expected that we would learn more about the story on site...  not so! lethargic staff half-heartedly escorted us to a disappointing experience in a series of rooms with equipment (flashlight, laser pointer) that was in disrepair for reasons other than zombie ambience. 

it's too bad as they are located in downtown toronto and it seemed like there were a lot of groups going through (ergo they could have afforded to pay for better upkeep and more attentive staff - perhaps even staff that would explain the story line). i'll definitely try another escape room, but probably not here."
506,"this establishment has outgrown it's community, patients hidden in every nook & cranny.  staff are knowledgable and friendly. the building it's self is extremely old and in need if repairs."
507,we used this firm for twenty years.  they over charged on repairs and started getting sloppy in the people that they hired.  i finally had to find someone new.
508,"they do not return calls to tenants. i have had my air conditioning go out the last 2 summers and it has taken them up to 4 days to get a repair person over when it was 110 + outside. they continually say they haven't received your rent check and charge late fees (and don't offer a rent drop box). this company sucks and i wish i had never rented from them. do yourself a favor and look somewhere else. this company also scores a ""f"" with the bbb."
509,"unfortunately, i had not read the reviews on here before calling these guys over to fix our washer and now regret it big time. we had the exact same experience. guy said he could fix for $300, or at least make it significantly better, while a full repair would cost over $1200. my wife signed and paid, he scooted off, was not only not fixed but worse than before. of course, when you call to complain they are only interested in now giving you the full repair. this place is a 100% absolute scam. do not use them, i don't believe they would ever have repeat customers."
510,"told me they are owed thousands of dollars from ge, so they wouldn't order the replacement part to my expensive and under warranty fridge. no idea why ge sends them out if they won't do any warranty work.

previous time they came out to repair leaking dishwasher, and the fix they used worked for 24 hours and started leaking again."
511,"i'm sure in its prime in the 90s this is the place to be, but now it is getting old - i mean old! perhaps a good renovation is called for. other than that it is still ok i guess."
512,"do not hire these guys under any circumstances.  i hired jimmy to repair a leak in my roof.   after i paid him over $1000 to fix it, the leak was worse than ever.  repeated calls and emails went unanswered for over a month.  somebody else came and charged $215 and completely fixed the leak in a couple hours.  wizard did unnecessary and expensive work and did not even fix the issue.  totally unscrupulous."
513,"this awful company promised to be here in sunday 21 sept and no showed again.  the home warranty company uses this shitty company as a vendor.
this is now the 5th time since 2 sept they have been to my house and repairs not made."
514,"alejandro helped us with finding our dining room table. it wasn't on the sales floor so we looked at a catalog and found what we were looking for. he was very helpful and answered all of our questions. 
lets just hope we like the dining room table when we get it! 

left the first part of this review a while ago. while all of this was true dealing with the delivery people was a nightmare. spoke to them several times to make sure they would arrive before i had to go to work and they assured they would but of course they didn't. annoying in itself. another reason i would never return here is because when i received my table there was a scratch on the lazy susan.. went to have it repaired and when i came to pick it up these people put freaking white out on it to repair it! so unbelievable! long story short .. ended up getting a replacement and i'm hoping i never have to deal with this place again."
515,"this company did an emergency repair for me a few months ago, so i went to them again to repair a leak, and to give me an estimate on re-routing some lines. the plumber, dan, did a good job fixing the leak (which involved replacing a standpipe), and then confirmed an issue with the water heater that we had suspected, an underground leak. in the process of doing this, he (hopefully inadvertently) turned off the water heater without telling me. as a result, we had no hot water, and were panicked that the leak had gotten much worse. i would probably have used mc for that repair (having not yet figured out that dan had turned off the water heater), but they were unavailable and i chose another company.

i also asked dan to install a shower head while he was here, for which he quoted $49. since he was already doing $200 in other work, and since installing a shower head takes about 3 minutes and no materials, i thought this excessive and told him so. he responded that ""this is our standard charge, no matter what else you're having done."" when i reminded him that this was a 3 minute job, he shrugged. i installed the shower head, which did in fact take 3 minutes.

i'm giving mc the benefit of the doubt and choosing to believe that dan didn't intentionally turn off the water heater to hasten our decision; otherwise this review would be 1 star."
516,"buyers beware if you need them to come out to asu to do repairs. i've been waiting two weeks for them to come out to asu with little to show for it. even when they finally responded, asking when i'd be available, i haven't heard anything from them over the four days since i told them when i was free.
when i called to ask what the hold up was, the only thing that happened was that i was rudely told ""to be patient"". that would have made sense if i called a day after my first call, but it was two weeks after the fact."
517,"i had to have the maid come in and change our sheets that had been changed earlier with sheets that were stained with who knows what.  but it was disgusting and i can't imagine the first maid that put the sheets on could have missed it.  

our neighbors had a nice screaming match that sounded like it could get violent at any moment.  i called security, they never showed.  

the hallways smell of old cat litter box. nasty! 

the front desk people are rude and don't even let you speak.  they just speak over you and tell you no.

the whole place is old and needs some serious renovations.  our room looked like they tried to remodel at some point but it was more of slapping some new stuff over the old stuff."
518,these guys suck. tj is a total jerk. waste of time and they don't know anything. they knew very little about repairs and were rude.
519,"dont get glass repaired here!! my friend had his straight shot sheldon black base/female joint repaired and they botched it. the down stem joint glass was all wave and bumpy crack on the instead that they said ""didn't matter"". the down stem did not fit, it allowed so much air threw it was un-rip-able and they wouldn't take it and fix it correctly after we paid them $180. not right"
520,"words cannot express how horrific my experience was with this company.  despite knowing that i am a senior citizen with a heart condition, they kept me waiting for several days, missed appointments, and failed to appear to compete repairs.  the temperature was 99 degrees inside my home!  when i kept getting excuses from amy, i asked to speak with the owner.  she informed me that she is the owner.  do yourself a favor, and avoid this company!!!"
521,"we purchased a house about 10 months ago, and leon made the inspection for us based on the recommendation of our agent (who was great, by the way).
at first we were very impressed with how thorough leon had been, showing us details we would never catch on our own.
when the monsoon, however, we realized he missed something huge: the roof.
the first windstorm broke half a dozen tiles on our roof, so i called a roofing company to do the repair.  the guy told us that the roof needed to have the felt re-done, since it was greatly overdue.  i called another 3 companies, and all of them told me the same thing. and since i have a clay tile roof, the lowest bid for doing the felt replacement was us$23k.
but it does not end there.  when the rain came, we had a leak. and then i noticed several water marks in the main roof bean  (exposed) in the living room, centimeters away from where our leak was.
how did he miss water stains to our roof bean?  good question. ask him."
522,"absolute garbage.  called and waited a few days for a washer repair.  technician came and made repair, but the very next day the washer was no longer working with the same issue (not draining).  called to report and reschedule ... but now i have to wait one week?!?!"
523,"this company is the worst. first american home warranty should be put out of business for constantly using them for ac repairs. the day they were suppose to come out, they were a no show. my ac is now broke again and have a feeling they are going to be a no show all over. i would avoid this company all together and avoid getting a home warranty through first american home warranty for using them."
524,had some come out for a tune up. my a.c. was working fine. after the tune up my a.c. does not work. the guy said i needed some part for $160 so i had it repaired and now the unit is not cooling my house. how does an a.c. repairman break your a.c. on a simple tune up??? i just got totally ripped off.
525,"had issues since day 1, had over a dozen maintenance repair for the same thing. nadia the manager is a selfish b!*@*  don't come here!  it looks great in the outside, but trust me i learned from my mistake."
526,"tech waived 69.95 cause charged 250.00 for repairs of a/c i agreed
then after he fixed he says i need  up to three pounds of antifreeze at cost 100.00 a pound, yikes i said ok only thing three  pounds i can't afford more. this is 300.00 on top of the 250.00 
after completed he hands m a bill for 703.10 i'm like what? . he then tells me he charged me 150.00 a pound each for antifreeze. i had to pay it. i told him him now i got to tell my husband my ears are broken. wth. i felt fleeced. i was fleeced. not only was i fleeced by a con man, i had to pay an exorbitant amount . i might add my ears are not broken. just shocked he was a nice guy it seemed but a flat out scammer. i would not recommend this company to anyone because of it. 

crooks and scammers possibly. can't believe they have a license."
527,"buyer beware!! bought a 22 cubic ft freezer for business, didn't work. they came out to ""see"" that it didn't work. then scheduled a time to ""pick it up"" and have it ""fixed"". sent me pretty much a beer cooler as a rental a week later. then tell me it will take at least a week to ""repair"" the original freezer. meanwhile.....manager tries to sell me a ""brand new"" 22 cubic ft freezer for $800 and he can have it delivered tomorrow. then proceeded to argue with me that i can't find a fridge for a better price.
hmmmm just found one at home depot for $604. again buyer beware!"
528,we had our hvac unit replaced on the 4th of sept. that part of the process went really great but a month later the frame work around my attic access that was damaged is still un repaired. i have called several times leaving a message for the owner to call me and after 3 weeks still no call. after this experience i would not recommend them at all if they can't fix something they damaged. all i get is excuses and still have an unsightly attic access.
529,"i don't know if anthem motorcycle repair is still in business. i called and left a message with my number on monday, but no answer. i called again tuesday and again left a message with my number. it is now wednesday at 6pm and i still haven't heard from this company."
530,"don't call norm!!!  when he was late arriving, i called for an eta. he told me i was late (i'm calling from home 30 minutes after the appointment time, who's late?). i asked if he still planned to come out, it was 92 in the house and i have a medical condition......norm's response???? he laughed at me!!!!! i'd rather sweat in the house any day before having an unscrupulous a/c repairman insult me. call someone else, and avoid his childish behavior."
531,"ben grant of grant renovations was hired to help with a small renovation job. job was for very specific week starting april 7, 2015 . he required deposit to hold those dates.

on april 6th at night, after multiple attempts to reach him, finally got a text letting me know he took another job so can't make it. i told him to refund me and he said no problem.

it's been now over 3 months of having to chase him constantly, and he's been abusive and rude and have yet to be refunded as promised multiple times.  even tried helping him with smaller payments spread out.

says he doesn't have it in one breath and then in next tells me he's on vacation. he has given me many promises to pay it on specific dates but those days come and go without him keeping his word.  and when i inquire, he is just insulting and aggressive.

basically a dishonest contractor who is trying to keep a deposit for work he never showed up to do.

not someone you ever want to hire."
532,"one of the worst experiences i've had at any repair (or retail) outlet in my life.

for one thing, the few times i've been there they're always condescending and rude. they act that they're doing you a great favor by charging $70+/hour to fix your mower. 

then they take a ridiculous amount of time to repair anything. if you're lucky, and after spending hundreds of dollars on things you didn't ask for them to repair, they may actually repair the mower to where it works for more than a week. i wasn't so lucky.........awful in every way."
533,"we had a terrible experience with this company. a home repair estimate took over 45 days to prepare, and it wasn't even correct! the project manager does not communicate to her customer, doesn't appear to want the business. do not recommend this company."
534,"poor quality repair. very expensive. they seem to specialize in making excuses for why things aren't their fault. i gave them three opportunities to make it right, and they didn't seem interested in the least. ""it happens"" and ""not my responsibility after 30 days"" blah blah blah."
535,"seriously? you check a diamond member into a room with ripped up bedding, dilapidated bathroom and a spider to greet me?

not that this is acceptable for anyone but based on my travel experience i'm aware that this does not meet the standards of the hilton family ... i predict this property will become an unknown brand very soon or perhaps the renovation is already scheduled???"
536,"called them to come and give me an estimate on my two balconies that need repair.  daniel came out the 21st of dec. and said he would send me an email with the estimate later that evening.  no estimate came that evening.  the holidays came and went, and on the 26th of dec. i texted daniel asking for my estimate again, and he replied much later that day to tell me i would get the estimate today.  so far, no estimate, but it really doesn't matter at this point.  he has already lost the job.  another contractor who doesn't do what they say they will.  update:  5th of january...still haven't heard a word from this company."
537,very rude and unprofessional. they will do repairs without giving you a quote first. they will also tell you one thing but then not honor it. recommend to anyone going there get everything in writing.
538,"my condo had a water leak a month ago. after having three plumbers come over and failing to locate the leak source, i contacted this company for leak detection. they sent felix over. he told me that they would charge me $600 for finding the source, but they wouldn't repair the leak. he also told me that he would come next day around 10am when community shutted water off. i waited whole day next day until 3pm when his office called me, asking for our gate code. about 4pm he called me, telling me they had found the leak source, not in my unit but in the pipes of common area, a hoa problem.
they charged me $600 but didn't locate anything specific. it took another whole week for our hoa to hire another company looking for the source, and eventually locate the source from another unit's water heater, not in the common area. i called robert, the manager, telling him that they mis-diagnosed the source, $600 charge was a rip-off, and asked for a refund. he refused. 
i want to add here that this company was no.4 company i called for finding the leak source. before them i used pure plumbing. they charged me $250 but couldn't find the source and then they made a full refund to me. 
how do you judge if you have a good company. see how do they treat you."
539,be very weary using them for repairs. they lied about turn around time multiple times and have no communication skills.
540,"do not use this company the company manger/part owner is an absolute nutcase, he will talk to and disrespect you, he makes a living as a contractor by ripping customers off and gouging on repair work. if you do not pay your bill he will threaten you and your family's life and make terroristic threats to you. we had to file a police report of this guy and his company."
541,"we have tried twice this place is not open. 
can't give any stars, 
still under renovation.  :(
no sign telling when it will be opening"
542,"i have some photos that i took after his repair.  i called him and he will  not come because he has to make up lies.  ed got paid and will not come
and fix the roof he supposedly repaired.  he is unprofessional and should
not be in business.  i did not ask anyone to write a review.  i have only
written it on my own experience.  remember your friend referred you that
you hung out with.  i dont know your mutual friends like tom."
543,"they waterproofed our house in 1985.  even after the city told them they needed a permit, they did not get one.  they used the wrong pipes... and we are now paying $10,000 to repair.  so i guess we have to sue for the damages.  city of westlake is appalled at the sloppy, below code work they did in 1985."
544,"i would not recommend doing business with this company. our new patio coating started to stick to our patio furniture. the owner blamed us for the issue and would not come out to look at her company's work after i requested a visit by the owner multiple times. the owner made us feel that our concerns were insignificant, made multiple incorrect statements in her emails about the situation, repairs already made were sufficient and we were at fault for not following their post procedure. we followed their instructions. any repairs on this product was now at a cost because of our negligence. my next step was a roc complaint, but i waited for their resolution since that is what the roc suggests to do... work with the contractor. after multiple emails and two months later, the patio was redone. yes, the patio looks better, but the trouble it took for us to resolve this issue was unnecessary. adding coating to your patio is an investment in your home and does not come cheap. i learn from this experience to find future contractors that make you feel that they put their customers first, and not to pay in full until you are able to use the product."
545,if i could give lower i would. sent out as a third party vendor to repair a home warranty issue on my refrigerator. rawn said he wasn't sure what was wrong and called his manager. said they weren't going to do a full repair but out of the goodness of their heart they would put in more freon. he said when it stopped working again call the company. lazy and unprofessional as can be. never use this company and kick them out when they show up.
546,"i purchased a sectional from pruitt's a year and a half ago.  this was one of the more expensive ones on the floor.  about 7 months after using it (just my son and i), the tufts came out.  pruitt's sent someone to my house to repair it.  6 months later, the tufts are again out of almost all of the cushions.  i just called to have it repaired again and now they want to charge me, with no guarantee that the tufts won't pop out again in 6 months, and every 6 months forever."
547,website advertises that they repair cameras. they do not. they box it up for $25 and ship them off to be repaired. seems a bit misleading to me.
548,ripoff that charged me $104.00 to tell me what 5 other places already told me. then they told me it would be $ 1500 to$ 2400 for head casket repair. the highest estimate i got for 5 other places.
549,"my son saw a 5th wheel that he liked there, he ask me to ride with him  to check it out ,i found several flaws in it ,they assured us if he bought it , someone would come out to fix the flaws, i wrote a check for full amount ,no one ever called about making repairs .when my son called them ,they basically gave him the run around, in my opinion  the place has damaged, or inventory that not up to top par,(not top quality products)its a bit of a scam the way they advertise,"
550,"would not recommend this company.  .  they are taking advantage of seniors who need repair saying that we need a new ac unit .  i have a small house, over 40 years old, only 1315 sf.  they quoted me $10,000.  found out they installed  the smallest unit available. they are dishonest. . do not call them."
551,"called them for an estimate on repair to roof/pergola.  he came out and looked at the job.  got on the roof and everything.  then called a week later saying he was still working on the estimate and he had to send a framer over to look.  and that was the end of any communication.  not even an i can't do the job or anything.  if you can't do the job, just say so.  don't waste everybody's time."
552,"worst builder i have ever had.  they take no pride in their workmanship or the trades they hire.  i would never recommend a friend or relative to buy a cresleigh home.  the problems that you will experience are throughout the neighborhood; paint chipping off after couple days, garages flooding due to driveway not being graded correctly, fixtures not installed properly, major cracks inside the house, windows leaking, plumbing having to be torn out due to being installed in wrong location, doors installed after walk thru and not painted, repairs taking 5 months, repairs take them 3 times and still not done correctly.  their famous words are, ""it's within our standards.""  which are bottoms of the line standards.  don't waste your money!"
553,met with owner to try and resolve my issue very disappointed with nothing being done i will not us this business ever again for any of my repairs.   i am not happy with nothing being done at all after our meeting.   it was a waste of my time.
554,"terrible company.  would not recommend them.  my warranty company needed them to make a second visit to my house for a 2nd review of a covered repair. they refused.

my warranty company has now assigned a different company to complete the repair."
555,"today these guys wanted 8k to replace one of the ac units and they said that was for the cheap one and a good one would be 14k. then they said the part that's in the attic that dispenses the air needed to be replaced as well but when he went and looked at it he said the other one for the other ac unit was in the way so he would have to replace them both. at this point it sounded like a scam. 

then they said they would leave a portable unit there for us overnight because there are two newborn babies in the house. but when they weren't sure we were going to spend 10k + with them suddenly they didn't want to leave the portable. 

needless to say we decided to get another quote and remembered there was an ac guy at church. he said if we wanted to spend 10k we could have a weekend at the red rock with the families and have a ton of fun and fix the ac. 

if you go with this company i would recommend getting a second opinion.

update: the repair cost 150$."
556,"lashes applied on a saturday morning. they where first wet monday morning in my shower. post shower i lost a quarter of them upon brushing.

i called i think tuesday or wednesday after seeing more loss. sassy where kind to offer an appt thursday but with my husband away and no baby sitting cover i couldn't make it until friday.

the time allocated to me to ""fix"" the problem was a whole 30 minutes! a full set takes 2 hrs.

i didn't  bother to turn up to the offered ""fix"" appt. a rushed 30 minute botch repair doesn't solve losing 90% of your lashes."
557,"we had work done with this company , numerous problems , when the salesman sold us the job he stated""you will have no more water problems"" the job was done - the first heavy rain water seeped into the basement , keystone came out made repairs another 3 months water once again they placed a plastic barrier on the walls which corrected the problem , at least we thought , water once again the floor in certain spots is damp even with a dehumidifier once again they come out and did a drill test their final conclusion water is coming in from ground water due too the fact your concrete basement floor is to thin wish they would have told us this to start with , i could have used the $10,500 on something else."
558,"our ac motor went out, juan their repair technician replaced the motor, wanted $700 for the motor. the motor was way to loud and next day it started going out, so we were without the ac all night and next day thanks to their work. when i called the next day and complaint asking them what kind of motors do they install that only last one day, they told me they don't know and to find somebody ales to fix it. so this is what you gonna be dealing with if you go with them. stay away from this company."
559,too bad i give these guys a negative star....my upstairs ac was blowing hot air and i called precision air to come and give me a diagnostic. the tech was here sunday afternoon and told me that to repair my unit would be between $4200 and $4800 to repair. he said i needed a new capacitor and motor or i could just replace the whole unit. i decided to get a second opinion. thank the good lord i did because they were definitely trying to rip us off. i had the parts replaced for $500. quite the difference.  do not use this company. they will charge you way more than what they should.
560,"great plumber if you can get him to your house. we used him for a couple small warranty repairs with no issues. when i tried to get him to come complete a job and write an estimate for a large job he would not show up. we had 3 appointments that he no showed for and when he finally came, he never provided me the written estimate. 

save your patience and call someone else. it doesn't matter how good a plumber is if they miss appointments without calling. i was very disappointed in this company."
561,"we  bought  a  groupon  for  an  a/c   inspection / tune up  which  was  supposed  to  be  worth  over  $ 100,-    technician  stated that he did  not  find  any  problems.

a  few  months  later  we  sold  the  house  and  the  buyer  ordered  a  home  inspection.   the  report  from the  home  inspector  (not  an  air  conditioning  specialist ...!)   showed   that  the  side  panel  from  the  air  handler  was  lose due  to  several  missing  screws  and  the  a/c  was  blowing  cold  air  into  the  attic.  

our  realtor   called  autumn air  and  of  course, their  answer  was ""when  our  technician  inspected  the  a/c  everything  was  perfect.... ""  between  the  lines:  ""we  went  into  the  attic and  removed the  screws because  we  needed  them  to  repair  our  kid's  toys"".  

nobody  went  into  the  attic  between  autumn air's  inspection and  the  inspection  of  the  home  inspector.   

safe  your  money,  these  guys  are  totally  unprofessional  and  unethical."
562,"used this company when it was a billion degrees and we needed a quick repair to keep our kids and dogs cool. seemed ok couple of years ago. called them about a week ago, downstairs unit not cooling. the texts from my husband started at a couple hundred dollars and went up to $14k by the time they left. needed 2 new units on a 10 year old house? really? a week later, due to our schedule being bad, another company came out, about 30 minutes of work, and my downstairs is ice cold. we'll never call one hour again."
563,i would not recommend them s place. checked in and went to our room. walk in and the room is in major need of repairs. wasn't even a door on the bath room.
564,"assigned by my home warranty company. horrible repair! they are just out to replace everything possible (and try to charge you, saying the home warranty would not cover it). luckily i understand a little bit about the repair that had to be done and was able to stop the guy from screwing me!"
565,"this is literally the worst company out there. our hoa spent $45k to get 8 buildings reroofed in 2014. very, very very long story short, they came in, did extremely bad work and now refuse to answer calls and emails. we've had leaks at every single roof!! that's right, all 8 roofs had issues with them. the board has tried contacting them dozens and dozens of times to try to get them to come out and fix the repairs and they are ducking all calls and emails. 

the warranty is for 10 years for parts and labor!!!

complete thieves, next step is we're filing a complaint with the contractors board.

do yourself a favor and stay away from these crooked ""roofers""."
566,"the plumber claimed that there was no way to repair the leaky faucet in my bathroom and that i would have to replace both faucets  so they would match.  
i didn't believe him so i had another plumber look at it and i turned out the valves from the wall were leaking. 

i ended up paying $69 for collins to do nothing."
567,"heritage was used by our builder, fulton. they left a large, unsightly & unsanitary gap at the range. they acknowledged their mistake in cutting the opening too large but still haven't repaired. there were more  issues/this company, send a message for more details. buyer beware."
568,"the worst company you can request for fixing your water issues! they come in with the religious pitch so you can trust them, and they do a half ass job, they even ran the pipe away from the pump so when the water came in, it still flooded my basement. brian (the boss) even laughed when i told him about my issue and refused to come out to fix it because i didn't send in my yearly $25. so i had a friend of mine do the repair. do not call this company ever, they are scam artist and they have non-reliable workers."
569,"i was in a hurry to get my muffler fixed. so made the mistake of coming here. it was noon, stated that i would need the repair before 5pm. i got the whole"" you need a new catalytic converter business or you won't e-check."" told them you t had just passed e-check. was told that they had to take the whole system off anyway because they couldn't fabricate a part. they put the truck on the rack cut the exhaust system off and there it sat untouched for five hours. at six pm. they were finished, told me that they had to fabricate a part is why it took so long. cost was over $1000. i will never return here."
570,"updating to include that now the shower is leaking water into our kitchen!!!! i am livid. will update as the never-ending problems with this renovation are handle.

updated june 5th to reflect leak issue repaired and messy grout job redone. after all this i finally have the bathroom i've always wanted now."
571,"called them to come and give me an estimate on my two balconies that need repair.  daniel came out the 21st of dec. and said he would send me an email with the estimate later that evening.  no estimate came that evening.  the holidays came and went, and on the 26th of dec. i texted daniel asking for my estimate again, and he replied much later that day to tell me i would get the estimate today.  so far, no estimate, but it really doesn't matter at this point.  he has already lost the job.  another contractor who doesn't do what they say they will."
572,"fired from the job nine weeks into a five week home renovation, they attempted to charge an additional $3,000 for architectural drawings despite no structural changes to the house. matter was forwarded to the board of contractors."
573,"a bunch of liars and crooks. they don't do the repairs they say they will, and then have the audacity to bill you for the repairs that they didn't do.

they are on ontario government's consumer beware list, and for good reason."
574,"i used this company a couple of months ago. they were extremely unreliable. they did not show up in the timeframe that they allotted. i had to keep communicating with them at least a dozen times for them to tell me that they could come around midnight. i gave them the benefit of the doubt because i needed furniture moved and rescheduled for two days later. they only had about 10 items to move which were large, heavy pieces. unfortunately they damaged one of the pieces as well as put two large marks in my walls. i filed a claim for the furniture as well as spoke with the manager a couple of different times and still have not heard anything about getting it repaired or reimbursed.
i highly recommend that you do not use this company!!"
575,"as a contractor mike at jolly plumbing worked for me on a home but failed to let me know that jolly plumbing was no longer licensed!  mike then  made a deal with the the same homeowner still without a license and tore up customers house for close to three months, this is when we found out he had no license. a family of six was without kitchen sink, dish washer, laundry and bathroom, finally homeowner so frustrating called another contractor who repaired everything that mike had damaged. mike has at every step of this whole ordeal lied and has continued to lie, he is not trustworthy. my recommendation is do not use this man or jolly plumbing. he will take your money and abandon project. we are going forward with the register of contractors concerning this matter."
576,"be weary of contacting owens chimney. we had them come out to clean our chimney and they basically told us that the inside of it had vertical cracks in it and that if we keep using it, it might set our house on fire! they also gave us a few hefty quotes to ""fix"" the issue (install new piping and extend the chimney or create a gas log fireplace). we got a second opinion and the second company found nothing wrong with our chimney and said that it hadn't even been cleaned. apparently, according to the owner of the second company, owens has a history of lying to their customers, showing pictures and videos that are not even from the chimney being inspected, and trying to trick customers into thinking their chimneys are in disrepair."
577,updating to include that now the shower is leaking water into our kitchen!!!! i am livid. will update as the never-ending problems with this renovation are handled.
578,"beware. this place will charge you outrageous move out fees to renovate your place to brand new conditions, regardless of how long you occupied. most tenants are charged upwards to $1000 in fees. many have claimed to never being informed of the fees and being sent straight collections, ruining their chances of future renting and owning property. the property is extremely slow for maintenance and repairs, some of which, you will be charged for. updates are out of the question. the property manager, veronica, never greets with any kindness or respect. the company that runs this place is deplorable. the negative reviews are very accurate. memories of this place will haunt you well after you leave. you have been warned."
579,"do not use a peoria to install or repair air conditioners! they installed a new air conditioner, after 3 visits to get it working after the disastrous install we had to pay additional 1500.00 to completely redo and fix the install. 
the new company found numerous mistakes, it never would have worked with a peorias installation. a peoria would not help with the additional cost. 
so sad to do this to a customer, wish we could give negative stars.

580,"just moved out after 12 months. way over priced for thin walls and incompetent leasing agents. the front office has no clue what they are doing. all repair requests had to been done multiple times to get things fixed. they screwed up the accounting multiple times and have these ""mystery fees"". this complex has more than it's fair share of shady tenants as well. stay away from this place!!!"
581,stay away!!!! find a real professional company!!! paid a bunch of money for them to tell me they could repair a simple gas leak.
582,i echo other reviews.  technician was 2 hours later than the scheduled window and when he arrived was dishonest in his assessment of the repairs on our unit.  naturally recommended replacement.  got another opinion and a simple fix.  better to get at least one other opinion if you are dealing with this company.
583,do not go their bad business their all liars . it took a month and a half to paint my truck and do repairs they drag their feet doing the job . not professional at all go somewhere else. turned them in too bbb still didn't finish my truck when i picked it up . isurance company actual got ripped off from this company. truck had a few runs from the paint job.
584,"sorry guys. i thought i'd found a good place but i had the same issue that another reviewer had. the told me i needed a very expensive repair that was not needed. i was really hoping that wasn't the case. ruling people off is just wrong and it won't get you more customers 
do yourself a favor and at least get a find opinion if they tell you you need an expensive repair"
585,"cost of repairs for land rovers is as high as the rumors state they are. i take my land rover to clint at mad city rovers off at stewart st (fish hatchery) and its nearly 1/6 the cost. 
clint is honest, hardworking, and a former employee of fields that left bc he didn't agree with the amt of $ they charged for minor repairs."
586,"i had a great experience with corey, my salesperson. the following review doesn't effect my experience, but rather the item. i bought a piece of jewelry, and was told that it was platinum. however, when i went to have the piece repaired, i was informed it was actually 14k white gold."
587,"used them once in the past, but just experienced a plumbing issue in a new house and called them.  was given a 1-3 hour time frame for a repair person to arrive.  after over 2 hours of waiting, someone called and said never mind, we don't have anyone available this weekend.  thanks for wasting my time."
588,"had roof checked out before purchasing current home 6 months ago and according to the inspector and the crew, only needed a half dozen tiles replaced. one large storm and these months later, my roof is in""rough shape"" and an estimate of over $12k given! for repairs, mind you, not replacement of roof. many pictures taken by the roofer but never sent to us so that we could even consider fixing it. i called and emailed to at least do our part on communicating. high cost, poor follow-through--there are
 too many competitors out there to be bothered with this company."
589,"they were good in helping to evict a tenant and they did fine me a new tenant. they  keep the pet security, even though i was taking the risk of the pet in my rental.  my big complaint is any repairs that need to be done had to be with there repair guys. the work was sub-par and expensive i did know this until i came to sale the house. i have had to redo a lot of their repairs. this including replacing my counter top because they installed a new dishwasher and put a screw hole up into the counter top causing a large hole that could not be repaired. then when i wanted to sale my home they made it very hard for me including putting the utilities in there name after i told them i was taking control of the house. this went on for three weeks. they wanted to sale my home and i already had a realtor. i would not recommend them."
590,"overrated and expensive.  if you are looking for quality repairs, they take too many shortcuts and don't do the job fully right.  if you are looking for economical repairs, they overcharge you for what you get.  go to artisan bodyworks and ask for martin to get the same or better quality repair for much much less."
591,"their work and response time was very good; however, the costs were way too high.  they came out on a sunday to repair an electrical problem that turned out to be a main circuit breaker and one gfci outlet.  the total bill came out to be $1435.00.  they charged $399.00 just for diagnostics, which could have easily been done with a simple multi meter  (measures current continuity, volts, amps, and resistance).  i would not recommend them to anyone because their costs are too high.

592,"terribly, unbelievably rude staff. i walked in with a repair, and was essentially yelled at by the guy behind the counter, for apparently giving incorrect details about my vacuum that i need fixed, which i did not obviously. extremely unprofessional. save your self respect, go anywhere else."
593,"had various repairs done to satisfy a home buyer. 
felt the fees were pretty steep. also the repairman got dirty fingerprints all over the walls where he was working. this was all freshly painted so i was very, very unhappy. i would not use them again personally."
594,"i've used this warranty company for years and i was frustrated with how they wouldn't repair things when they were not ""installed properly"" even they did a inspection on the house before i signed up.  now they are charging $600 some dollars to replace the water heater at my rental due to ""other costs"".  $600 is enough to buy a brand new heater and installed by a plumber!  i am switching warranty company to fidelity home warranty where if you get comprehensive coverage, they would repair things that were not installed property.  hope fidelity won't disappoint me :)"
595,"my stay was welcomed by a sales agent pushing me to go to one of there timeshare sales meets; she tricked me by thinking she was showing me the registration desk, i quickly realized i was in the middle of a sales pitch; the room was to be at the updated tower but it was poorly updated; more of a quick renovation with a door handel missing from the closet and melody on the shower lamp; not impressed at all..."
596,pretty cheap looking place. they could definitely do with a renovation. funny standup though. waiters are shit. we were seated in a terrible spot right by the kitchen and bathroom. pretty much where most of the traffic is. worth about half the entrance fee imo.
597,"i called j&d 3 times, on 3 different days, leaving a detailed vm each time regarding the problem and asking whether it was available to repair it - i received no response. given the good reviews, this was particularly disappointing."
598,"terrible experience! their technician literally ruined my home when the ceiling came down from a leak in the attic that he refused to check and repair. they also refused to refund my money, this company has zero integrity!  will be reporting this to the bbb. after reading this comment below from tonya, it sounds like penguin is grasping for straws. pictures don't lie and typing up a book of excuses  doesn't help their company look any more honest. they have several bad reviews and i wish i would have read them before i used this sleazy company.terrible experience! their technician literally ruined my home when the ceiling came down from a leak in the attic that he refused to check and repair. they also refused to refund my money, this company has zero integrity!  will be reporting this to the bbb. after reading this comment below from tonya, it sounds like penguin is grasping for straws. pictures don't lie and typing up a book of excuses  doesn't help their company look any more honest. they have several bad reviews and i wish i would have read them before i used this sleazy company.

599,"they showed up 5 days early without even a call or letting me know, then worked for about an hour and left. they sent me no pictures or explanation or what was replaced or repaired. when i called and left a message and emailed trying to get information on what they actually did; i was ignored on both fronts. what a way to spend 878 on a roof repair, total lack of professionalism, they just came out when they felt like; did what they felt like with no proof or explanation, and then ignored contact attempts."
600,"i would strongly recommend that you use a different electrician - these guys charge $150 per hour, and are not professional in appearance or in their work product.  i'll have to get someone else out to fix the items that i had them repair.  i only gave 1 star to be kind."
601,"called this company to get an estimate for a number of plumbing repairs in my home. everything was going fine until they smelled an opportunity to rip me off as contractors are wont to do.

i had a steam shower heating unit which needed to be replaced. it didn't look like such a complicated job and it turned out not to be. i had someone install it in just a few hours.

the new unit cost around $1,400 on amazon and also from several plumbing supply places on the internet.

so how much do you think pure plumbing wanted to charge me for a few hours labor? plumbers are expensive, right? $50 an hour? $100 an hour? $150 an hour?

well, the total for the parts and materials was $3,845 plus a ""15% discount"" for a total of $3,268. 15% discount from what? that should have been a red flag (not that it mattered - i didn't use them anyway). give me an estimate. don't give me an estimate and then a b.s. ""discount."" discount from what? your own price? next time i give someone an estimate, i think i'll tell them, ""$50,000 plus a 90% discount for a total of $5,000.""

anyway, assuming that they pay the same amount for the unit as i can from just about anywhere, that leaves them with around $1,900 in labor for a 3 hour job.

let's be generous and say it takes them 4 hours. that's a mere $467 an hour. no thanks, unless you are going to do my taxes and give me a medical exam also.

good luck with this company. i cannot say how they would have done with the various jobs i was given an estimate for, but i am not going to find out. i will never do business with a company that thinks that they can charge me a ""set fee"" for a job which really is some outrageous $ per hour. this is all too common in the business world. i always ask or estimate how much time a contractor or worker is going to spend doing a job at my house and the price better be commensurate with that time."
602,"after 5 months and 5 visits our dishwasher still has the same problem we called about in the first place. we are forced to use them by home warranty.  they have given a 4 hour window of arrival all 5 times and have come 20 minutes later than that time frame on 2 occasions. we are at 23 hours of waiting for this company. they claim to need a part and will call when it comes in. my husband calls 4 weeks later and it just came the day before. yeah right. next time they 'need to order a part', we call 6 weeks later and are told they received the wrong part and had to re order. lie or just irresponsible? doesn't matter to me, still bad business.  christian added to the name is disgraceful for a company that has been less than honest and diligent in completing a job they are paid for. zero stars if it was an option. forget home warranty.  if time off work waiting is money we could have paid for the repairs 5 times by now!"
603,"total lack of internal communication.
after many calls finally got hold of someone in the office. was told will send someone to look at my waranty repair but could not give any date. week later my neighbor called me someone is on the roof. by the time i got home (20 min) he was gone. repeated request to get someone to repair my leak was lost in the front office."
604,"sprung a leak in our water heater hose.was told by the tech that since the pipes coming out of our house were plastic that they needed to be replaced by copper ones to be compatible with the repair process.was also advised that since our water heater was over 6 years old their company policy is that they would only replace it.they would not repair it!the estimate for the new water heater,pipes and hoses was $1,600!we called a few of their competitors and asked them if this was a standard policy among plumbers.one company had a plumber over within an hour who was able to replace just the hose for a fraction of what george brazil quoted for their repair.needless to say we will never be calling this company for anything ever again."
605,"we have dogs, so we stay at la quintas when we travel. most are average quality since they are pet friendly. but this is the worst la quinta that we've stayed at. it is in desperate need of a renovation. the rooms that they had available to us were all smoking rooms. we started off in one room, the smoke smell was so terrible that we requested a different room. they moved us to another room, that was also a smoking room but had less of a smoke smell. instead, it had another awful smell coming from the bathroom. even my 3 year old complained that the smell was ""yucky and gross.""  and the room was dirty! i've included pictures that show stains on the walls and ceilings. 

avoid this place unless you are a smoker. we will definitely not be returning. the one star is for the friendliness of the front staff."
606,"warning - i took my daughter's instrument in for a minor repair ($60 worth).  i was informed it woud take a week up to 10 days. what i was not told is that the they were counting 7-10 business days.  my daughter will not be able to perform this week without the instrument. :( :( :( :( :( :(   it takes a few days or more for the repair center to get to the instrument and evaluate it.  then they need many more days to repair it (it has to wait in line).

tip:  when you take an instrument in for repair, ask for a date range of when these two events will occur."
607,"they are terrible. they seem friendly but do a lousy job. they were called to fix my air conditioner. they came two days later and everything seemed fine. they were here for an hour seemingly doing stuff but on the report they put ""diagnostics"" as the only work done and replaced the thermostat. very shockingly i find the a/c stops working shortly after they ""repaired"" it. so we setup a time for the day after it was ""fixed"" and they cancel on us for unknown reasons and we agree on the next day. next day comes and they dont show up or respond to any communication attempts. 

we will be going with a real company now to fix our problem. do not use these guys. they are not worth the trouble. they seem to pull the same stuff by the looks of the last review."
608,"when the guy wrote our estimate, he said not a big deal just would take time. time is money and george brazil wanted a shiiz ton...like 4500 over what a great local handyman estimated! woohh talk about over head. something to think about just make sure you guys insured and checking bbb isn't a bad idea either..but george brazil is a pass for us!"
609,it smells good inside unlike other casinos where the smell of cigarettes is very obvious. we stayed at the cheapest room and it doesn't look like what it is in their website. room is already old. renovation is needed. it sucks too
610,crap company overall. techs are rude and lack appropriate knowledge. came to my house for a microwave repair and lied to me and my hone warranty company. stay away.
611,"this company is a complete sham! ""jessica"" told me that the compressor for the a/c unit would be covered, they could not get anyone out there for 2 more days (never mind that it was 103 degrees outside when i called). after much frustration and finally having to get the local sales rep involved, they scheduled repair for the next day. only, they would not cover the compressor repair. they have only one repair company that they work with for everything and refuse to extend beyond that one company when it is  too busy. stay away from this warranty company and go with a larger company if you feel you must have a home warranty."
612,"went in for a basic wash, left with a repair bill over $500.  my whole experience was extremely disappointing from the front end greeters to the owner.   i hate dealing with unscrupulous people and businesses."
613,"i can't believe this place is also their repair and parts place for all oster products as well. my blender blew a fuse and i contacted myric to look for a replacement fuse since they were listed as the authorized parts place in calgary for oster products. they were rude and not helpful. to top it off, i couldn't believe that authorized oster parts place in kelowna sold the fuse i was looking for and yet in a city like calgary, we have a oster parts place that didn't."
614,"they finally wrote a letter in response to by bbb complaint that was littered with inaccuracy both in their account of the communication between us and in the way a professional repair facility is supposed to make repairs like this.  

i have replied with documentation from witnesses at the scene to verify my communication to them and have supplied several websites and articles verifying that the procedure they informed the bbb was necessary is categorically false.  

i am awaiting their reply."
615,"visiting sun city elk member. the home members and bar tender were welcoming and kind. it would have been a terrific evening inasmuch as it was karaoke night with a few talented songbirds. however, i'll never set foot in the door again because indoor smoking is allowed unrestricted. no amount of blowing air conditioning removed the 2nd hand smoke stench in the air, on our clothes, from our throats. it's readily apparent the lack of a no smoking inside rule has driven off members because most of the lodge attendees were guests. also showed in the bathrooms and common areas in bad need of repair. no funding for upkeep. pretty sad."
616,"used to be the imperial palace.  it is like a maze in there and it is outdated even though they are doing renovations.  it was very affordable and clean though.  the thing that bothered me was that my window on the 12th floor didn't lock.  not that i would think someone would be stupid enough to go out on the balcony and walk into my room, but in vegas, you just never know!"
617,"this particular location used to have good pizza but i think i'll be going to a different franchise. the pizza has become really thin and hard with hardly any pizza sauce, the new renovation looks good but leaves very little room for customers when busy. there pizza is edible but that's about it."
618,"i'm really confused, is this place actually an active business? on the website they say they are open 7 days a week and that they take walkins everyday from 12-5. yet whenever i try to go, it's closed. there's no sign that says their hours or that they are doing renovations, they are just closed. too bad. i wanted to give them my money. i have also tried calling and no one answers. pretty shitty way to run a business if you ask me."
619,"this location has closed, due to the renovation of station square.  visit them in south hills village or robinson."
620,"we have had 2 repairs on our dryer this week and we are currently awaiting a 3rd repair.  we had to wait 5 days for the first repair, 3 days for the 2nd repair, and it will be 5 days before the 3rd repair which we are hoping will be the final one.  you appear to have a bad batch of parts on your repair truck.  my complaint is that you are making us wait so long between repairs for something that is your fault.  you do not seem to accept that you should consider our problem an emergency when it has gone on this long. routing takes no responsibility for getting anybody out here sooner. the repairman is nice and seems competent but he can only work with what he has in his truck and with the schedule that he is given."
621,"this company is the worst and aimee, heather, and kenny pretty much just vomit promises without standing behind them. we rent a few commercial properties in phoenix and this company is by far the worst to deal with. they send a porter to check the roof and give them a report versus having a professional roofing company come out and make the necessary repairs. if everything is okay, then why does the roof leak? they have been telling me that they are working on the roof for almost a year now and there are still tremendous leaks. every time it rains it's the same story, ""everything was fine when we checked it"". their neglect must be the only way they're making money on these properties. stay away from college park, a property they manage, and be cautious if you must do business with this company."
622,notified gary dircks vie text message on 4/30/18 that there's a water leak. it is now 5/23/18 and it's not yet repaired. my water bill went from $160 to $250 a month. i have notified him of the a secondary leak multiple times also and it's not been resolved. on 4/10/18 gary dircks stated he will have the gate/barrier installed which is a requirement for an inspection. that did not happen until 5/22/18. it took almost 6 weeks!
623,"i wouldn't give any stars if i had the option.  my children and i couldn't even sleep in our home last thanksgiving weekend because there were no bathrooms available for use, nor were there any agents from ""the andrew team"" available to get a plumber to fix it.  to top it off, they charged me for the plumbing and the full rent for a home i couldn't use....there's more.

my initial walk through clearly stated repairs that needed to be made.  my ending security deposit however did not.  they used my security deposit to call a kitchen sink and fix leaky plumbing that was busted long before i got there.  charged me $500.00 for it.  i never once used my dishwasher because of the leak from this kitchen sink which was in my initial walk through as well.  

i will never use anything with this company anywhere on this planet ever again.  i am at a complete loss of words for the criminal acts i have just witnessed and they get away with it because they knew i was first time renter and a bit naive of what was going on.  bullies to boot.  

go remax/ andrew team!"
624,"i requested an estimate at my home for some repairs and new additions to the drip lines. they showed up over an hour late and completed the estimate in the dark. we agreed to the work and on the day of the installation they were a "" no show"". i haven't heard from them since. i should have known better.  very unreliable."
625,"most of the staff have been great! the lady at registration , yesenia was fabulous! ! steve the repair man (our t.v. wasn't working ) was friendly! !! but the girl at the valet pick up window brittany, was so rude! not friendly, was bothered that we even asked for assistance"
626,"today we are without daytime water for the fifth out of eight days. no kidding!

this place is not aging well and the water mainlines are failing. the latest ""excuse"" is that they have tried ""temporary"" repairs, but they don't hold up.

if they would install new mains in parallel with the existing ones, that would fix the problem once and for all."
627,"they had my receiver over a month and did nothing but a ""factory reset.""  i had to keep calling them to get the status every time.  painfully slow!  if you have warranty work it will be less frustrating to ship it to a real repair center."
628,"i gotta give it two not one because i love the medieval times, but this place needs a serious renovation!"
629,"they convinced us of lazyboys famous good name, hence we paid $2800 for a couch and love seat being told of the guarantee.  two years later it's junk.  it's bare bones folks, cheap thin frame (barely) and sunken lumpy cushions.  we had a repair guy here twice and he simply stuffed more foam pieces in a cushion making it more lumpy.  two of the recliners foot rest sit on the floor tight.  if you lean on an arm you  can hear cracking of the  thin piece of wood barely holding this together.  really mad at ourselves for not paying much less for a better quality couch and loveseat. there is nothing too this junky couch. and only two years?   you will be sorry if pay top dollar for this skimpy frame with cushions that will not be firm for long.  waste of money.  so glad we didn't also buy the highly overpriced sofa sleeper."
630,"this place is closed. not sure if its closed for renovations or something else. however, after looking at the yelp reviews i am glad we didn't get to try this place. must've been crappy. wasted my time trying to look for it the other day."
631,"i utilized wade & his company a couple of years ago to have repairs done. capacitor as well as a motor replaced. ""never again""!!! the capacitor was never secured ...laid up against the empty box it came in. i had a rosie on the house certified technician come out to do a tune up in april of this year and disclosed this to me. not only did he share this with me but also informed me of a exposed wire.  no. thanks"
632,"i will never play this course again. for some reason they like to have rocks in their bunkers. as such i now have to see if i can get my 6-iron, that is less than 6 month old, repaired."
633,they tried a bait and switch on a repair that i had brought in and discussed the previous day.
634,"i appreciate that they were quick to respond to a problem that my tenant was having.   however, when i first contacted them and explained the problem i was told that that's an easy fix and a $40 job.  i then get a call the day after the work was done asking me to pay $158!  when i asked what happened to the easy $40 repair i was told that the part was $40.  i told him that the next time he gives anyone an estimate it would be a good idea to include the labor in there."
635,"if there was a way  to rate them with negative stars that would be my preferred rating . from start to finish it was one excuse after another . the only thing that happened on time and accurately was our payment to them . we called and asked them to repair the failing product , again more excuses . and finally they refused to warranty the product , and suggested we pay more to fix the problem . don't use this company they are crooks . now i am paying more to repair it the shoddy job they did ."
636,"update:
just a couple of hours after posting this, they sent me a two line quote for $8100.00 for a 14 seer unit. no mention of brand, tonnage, or what's included.
that's nearly two thousand dollars more than some other companies i've had come out.
think about it. 2 grand. that's nuts.
to add insult to injury, the $8100 is after they deducted $250 for the govt. rebate.  problem? the government rebate currently being offered is five hundred dollars!
would i ever hire this company?
never.
seriously disappointed​.
they have great reviews, but they seem to be mostly for water purification systems. i called because my 19 year old ac system died, and its time for a new one.
the teach came out, and seemed pissed that he wasn't doing a repair.
it's now been a week, and i don't have my quote for a new system.
they may be awesome, but if they don't want to sell me something, i really can't recommend them.
especially since they knew i had no air."
637,"had a pipe leaking last week.  they were wonderful, came out within a few hours (not after hours) and made a small hole in ceiling.  quickly cut out a 6 inch section of pipe and welded in a new one.  i'm thinking, oh this wont be too bad.  almost $600!    then i had to hire another company to dry out the area and repair drywall."
638,"i never write reviews but i was given a window between 9am and 2pm, so i have be waiting for the technician. it is now past 3pm and no one has showed up, called, emailed, and every number they have goes straight to voicemail. i dont like giving bad reviews but this is ridiculous. if a technician or even if someone calls me to let me know whats going on i will write a review based on that experience and cancel this one. hope they contact me soon i really need to get this repaired, i drive for a living and am not allowed to work to provide for my family until this is fixed. hope you can understand my frustration."
639,brought in a ps4 for repair of hdmi and less than a month later the input stopped working again. it worked at first but suddenly stopped working. they want to charge me $80 again when it's their work that didn't hold up. i do not recommend this place. go somewhere else.
640,"i do not recommend this company at all! my warranty company recommend them. i took off half a day of work. they came out and the repairs lasted not even 48hrs! same issue happened again. 

they also charged the company for work they didn't complete!"
641,"called george brazil electrical when the only outlet in my garage failed. i was afraid it might be a more serious problem, and i didn't know which circuit breaker was the correct one. 
ten minutes work by the repairman and one new $5 receptical later, i had a bill for $355.63, based on george brazil's guidelines.
shameful.
the repairman was courteous and knowledgable, but i don't know how he can sleep at night."
642,i never had a problem with this company until this year. my ac has been out since the 2nd of august. couldn't get a repair out to my house until today 05aug2018. this is vegas!!! this heat is murderous!!!!! there are 24 hour ac repair places but i had to wait 3 days. then the repair company that was sent said it would be another week before my ac is properly fixed. you can't get ahold of anybody at this damn company. this is my last year. i'm done!!
643,"i had a great room and kitchen remodel done in the summer of 2014, and the contractor (az integrity builders) subcontracted with larry from kitchen works to do the cabinet work in the kitchen.  the old cabinets were refinished white, and some additional new matching cabinets were constructed.  within 18 months the paint was chipping off the cabinets!  at the time the contractor told me to take it up directly with larry.  he said the problem was with my cabinets and not him, and said if i removed the doors and took them to him he would make repairs. i was unable to do that at the time. i just went and inspected the property (which is now rented) and the cabinets are much, much worse! paint is coming off everywhere, even on the new cabinets that larry made, so the problem was not with my original cabinets (which were solid maple).  larry did a terrible job and does not stand by his work.  i wish i was able to attach pictures to this review!"
644,would not buy from here ever again. $54 dollars for a controller that never even worked. both triggers wouldn't work on games. came in tried to repair it twice. still would not work. unreasonable price for a used controller
645,avoid at all costs and i do mean costs if you are getting repairs.my brake line went out and they quoted me $1100 to fix it plus rear brake rotors and ceramic pads( of course they did not quote metallic pads because hey they are less expensive). the rotors were not gouged as they stated and the pads were less than 3 days old and were fine.                                         i went somewhere else and had it done for $335 and all of the rear hardware was okay.
646,"these guys have made a business out of doing as little as possible, and taking as long as possible to do it, if they even show up. their drivers sit at the gate, wait 30 seconds and then leave. this allows them to charge you a ""no call no show"" fee without even having to lift a finger. i was forced to pay that fee and also fix my own electrical issue because of the contract with the p.m. no one else could be called for the repair. i literally sat in the dark for 7 weeks. do yourself,and for the love of god your tenant, a favor and pick another company to give your business to."
647,"we bought a fountain from these guys in early 2017 at the suggestion of our contractor. on the day of delivery, preassembled, the concrete fountain arrived but some pieces were different colors than the others. to fix that, they cast new molds within a day and the fountain went in. within 4 months, however, the fountain cracked and leaked. 

my contractor tried to fix the first crack with a sealant, and that held for nearly a near, until that, too, failed. then another deep crack formed in another bowl. 

not only that, but the seals between fountain sections had to be re-applied 3 times over a year and a 1/2. when we finally had enough, it took literal months, working with my contractor, to get someone to work with us at phoenix precast. 

we weren't asking for a handout, but wanted to swap out this poorly designed and improperly fired fountain for a simpler design. the best precast would do? offer to refine the 2 cracked bowls at cost. but that doesn't fix the other leaking sections and would still cost us out of pocket to fix their badly fired bowls. 

will never do business with this company again. they make a junk product that they do not stand behind. 

and, for the record, i have issues with my contractor, too, who continued to try and repair this junk fountain instead of replacing it within the warranty period. but that is for another review."
648,kipp came out two weeks ago and i still have not received a quote!!!   i need a repair done and no one will get us a quote.
649,do not use. they completely messed up the diagnosis. they told my plumber where the manifold was and where they thought the leak was. totally wrong and cost me extra time and drywall repair. would not respond to me. waste of over $200. use someone better!!
650,"scam artists. they knew who i was when i returned a camera one month after purchase that was completely broken, won't even turn on, stuck shutter. they did nothing. no refund, no replacement, no repair. they ignored me and basically tuned me out until i left. do not trust these scammers."
651,"my grandmother needed to have two plug outlets replaced. it turned out that after the tech did the troubleshooting, it was determined that 5 outlets were going to have to be replaced? after the ""pushy"" tech urged that the whole property be rewired for an absurd amount, she decided to just get fixed, what needed to be fixed at that time. the 5 outlets that were replaced came to over $1,015.00 dollars before tax! when she showed me how much she paid i felt terrible because i was the one who recommended she call george brazil. i called and left a message with the manager to explain to me why they charged her so much for that job. when you break that down, that's over $675.00 an hour for the 1 1/2 hours the tech spent doing the job. nobody ever returned my message, which was no surprise. so, i ended up talking to a friend of mine who knew an electrician and had him come out to look at what was done. i was told that he would have troubleshot and done the job for between $250.00-$300.00. i really wish that i would have had my grandmother contact that person first, but i figured that a couple of outlets shouldn't be too expensive. i had expected that she would have to pay a little more money because george brazil is a big name, but i never expected the repair would have come to over one thousand bucks! i am never going to recommend george brazil to anyone again, or ever call them myself. i would highly recommend using any another company instead of any work that george brazil does. if you do call george brazil, at least get another estimate from someone else before they do any work for you, so you don't get ripped off either."
652,"this company is horrible.  they were sent out for a warranty repair which all agreed was not going to be covered.  the ""plumber"" spent less than 2 minutes, declared the water heater broken, and collected his $60 check without doing any work or diagnostics (like to explain why all the water was cold, not hot).  rip-off!"
653,equipment is broke take a while for repairs mens sauna has been broke for at least 2 weeks staff not in any hurry to fix it. will probably cancel my membership and join athletic club.
654,"gothic did the landscaping for the model home that we purchased. on the surface it looks wonderful; however, they cut corners on the elctrical for the water feature. had to have two different electricians fix issues. the feature now has it's second leak and they continually miss appointments to come fix repairs. the home builder used them is the only reason we still continue dealing with them. if i could give negative stars i would."
655,this review is not to specifically destroy north face as a brand . but their guarantee isn't really clear and they've held a jacket i've sent in to get repaired for the past 6 months .
656,"i would not even give them a full one star!!! $280 plus tax to fix dishwasher and still have the same problem.  i wish i had checked the reviews first.  the repair man came twice, the second time he did not even hook up the dishwasher, really? i still have the same issue.  wanted to charge $700 for a part and that does not include labour or tax."
657,"glass is cheap breaks if you repair with daisy total rip off stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
she pretends to be good she evil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
658,"damn expensive!

$750 for a valve change! the plumber left a big hole in the bathroom. had to pay a separate handyman to fix the hole. the handyman told he would have changed the valve and fixed the hole for $200. plus parts, so around $350 total.

plumbing is a mean business. you don't know how good life is until you lose your water supply... in the desert. so yeah, we got desperate and hired the 1st company we contacted.. without doing any other research. so yeah, we paid the price. total damage was over 900 bucks.

ps

the plumber himself is a nice guy. knows what he's doing. but the company he works for is super expensive."
659,the quad formerly imperial palace. major renovations being done here but they haven't done the rooms yet. hopefully next time i visit it will be done. but......it's a step up from what it was for sure. can't ever beat that location either.
660,repair work is great but $$$$$$$$$!!!! i paid $30 to reglue a strap on my tory burch sandal!
661,"wow. staffing issues?? in today's work climate? i just don't get it. if you hate your job that much then just quit. this franchise at this location will be closed up in short order. looks old, cooler needs repair....no vanilla???? ... check out where it used to be..
i guess those other two delicious desert places very near by will gain some clients...."
662,i would like to give a zero if i could. my home warranty sent this company out to repair my air conditioner which was turning off and on. they said they could not repair my air conditioner because it happened to be on and not off that moment. they said my air conditioner was not installed to code and would require thousands of dollars to even get a quote so i should by a new one which my home protection company would not cover. i said this was not acceptable and the tech said he did not have to listen to me and stormed out of my house. this company is very dishonest. never hire them.
663,"update:  he's combative too.  read his answer below.  i certainly didn't get anything longer than a 30 day warranty.  also, who said it was 4 months ago?
i brought my surround system in for repair to the dvd player. he charged me an absolute fortune, and the dvd player worked very noisily for  exactly 32 days.  complete rip off."
664,"ever since the owner steve brown died, his nasty abusive wife has taken over. he was a great friendly guy. honest, did good work and sometimes didn't even charge for teaching me how to do my own repair!"
665,"i called gabriel's because my dryer had stopped drying. i told jeff that i thought it was a clogged vent. he informed me that it would cost $69 to send out a repairman, and i agreed. when the repairman arrived, he announced that it was a clogged vent, but they don't fix clogged vents what?! why wasn't i told that when i originally called? then the repairman gave me the numbers of two places that vacuum vents. (one was a wrong number and the other was out of business.) finally, the repairman offered to replace the part in the dryer that was making the drum squeak - for an additional $87. just great; then i'd have a noiseless dryer that cost me $156 and still didn't work."
666,nice people but very dishonest. they recommended repairs that were not necessary and tried to charge several times more than market price. i guess i should have known better but i found another place who was honest and charged a fraction of the price. this place also tried to invoice me for work not performed.
667,"a very similar experience as another review here. i am greatly concerned i too was oversold on a repair that he said was my motor.  at the end of the day it was not the motor it was another part which only cost a little over $100 to which he quoted me over $400!  i called and complained and spoke to a manager to which he did nothing.  don't use them, up selling is what they do."
668,"the technician from this company was very unprofessional and tried to scam us for a repair that didn't need doing. we were having a/c issues, he made my tenants very uncomfortable with his unprofessional behavior and language and never walked out to look at the a/c units. he told us the repair ""needed"" was not coveree under our warranty and we would be out of pocket would cost $2,300. he recommended smart thermostats and a new zoning board, but he would take off $200 for being home warranty customers. he wanted to replace 5 perfectly fine thermostats in the home and the zoning board. he was also very convincing. however, it was quite uncomfortable when he said not to call after 9 because he didn't want his fiance to think i was a booty call. 

all we ended only needing more refrigerant for the a/c units.  i would never recommend this company to anyone."
669,"estimate of repair = $40, cost of repair = $250

i was told the repair cost was ""very affordable."" the estimated cost of repair and the actual cost of repair were not even close, and definitely not reasonable."
670,"called to get a quote. told me i needed a handyman. no, i need stucco, wholes patched, metal primed and painted and trim on my house painted so i can sell it. if i wanted and needed a handyman i would have called one."
671,got some new furniture and when delivered a end table was damaged.  i told them i wanted a new replacement.  ashley's makes you go thru the repair process before they will replace the item.  i was livid as i did not want a brand new table repaired...really ashley's!  i will never buy from them again!!!!!!
672,"scheduled time to repair sprinkler and my follow up call didn't recall the conversation and argued about whether i had called

needs to change his meds"
673,"guy came out and tried to sell me the most expensive option. scheduled it for a few days later but got other opinions. someone else actually took the time to analyze the issue, give me their best diagnosis and why, made the repair and proved why i did not have to go the most expensive option. 

did business with the second company for being honest. 

my whole pipe was not corroded. the metal lid apparently struck my pipe and caused a pinhole leak. 

saved me $3,000"
674,"buyer beware!  check their reviews with the better business bureau for their veracity.

first photo is three weeks after ""repairs ""

second and third photo is 4 days after second and third ""repair""

lots of no calls, no show

buyer beware. i have threatening emails, threatening texts and several witnesses to threatening actions. reminds me of mob mentality"
675,"i purchased a product to repair a damaged quickbooks data file. first, i ran the demo version, which showed our data would be recoverable, so i purchased the full product. after running the repair, the damaged file still did not work (in fact, would not even open). i requested a refund. 

their refund policy here https://www.stellarinfo.com/support/kb/index.php/article/stellar-refund-policy 
 states that a refund will be issued under the following circumstances: 

1. if, the client was able to preview all the recoverable data with the demo version of the software and was unable to recover with the full version (which is exactly what happened). 

2. request for rma number is made within 30 days (which i did). 

3. i uninstall the software and provide you with an affidavit of destruction within 35 days (which i am willing to do, but they have refused to provide me with the paperwork). 

when the prodcut failed to repair our file, i solved the problem with a different software. however, stellar data recovery refuses to honor its refund policy, instead trying to get me to work with their tech support people. the product failed to work as advertised, and i followed their procedures to request a refund in accordance with their guarantee. 

worst $250 i've ever spent."
676,"because of its location and renovations, we cannot be mad at the oyster bar

677,cici's in lv needs to get their act together. 2 times i've tried to visit now. first location is closed for renovations or something. nothing on the web about that. next week i try a different location. hours online say 10pm. pull up at 8:55 to locked doors and a paper sign that says they close at 9pm. feel like i'm trying way to hard to get mediocre pizza.
678,had a small leak from my tub so i gave them a  call.  when the plumber came he told me that to fix it they were going to have to rip out the tub and have to redo everything it was going to cost $2600 plus new tub and of course then i would have to redo the tile work and wall repair.  this small repair would have cost me at least $4000.  so i got a second opinion and got it all fixed for $450. new canadian plumber is a dishonest company.
679,"kristi
the furniture was never fixed! your repair company was too busy to get it in and i have never heard from you since. nor are you licensed or insured! that's why i filed in small claims court. we will see you in court."
680,"i deleted my last review (2 stars) a few months ago, at the personal request of david s. the company owner.

he called me after reading my review on yelp and offered to refund my inspection and help pay for the major plumbing repair his inspector man missed. david said he'll do this, so long as i immediately delete the review on yelp --- which i did.

now it's months later and david has held half-true to his word. he refunded my inspection, but i'm still on the hook for the major damage his man missed. 

i feel let-down and betrayed by the company owner. david told me that he'd do everything to push the 90-day warranty claim through, he gave me the claims information and told me to get to work. i spent hours filling the claim. after a few months, the claim is denied, and david make a full-180 and refused to help me. 

i have an email from david today and i quote:
""there is no 90 day warranty through us.""

i'm now on the hook for a major plumbing repair. welcome to my first new home. thanks for nothing, david."
681,"not based in science, pretty embarrassing, this place was in disrepair and downright dirty.  since it is so bad, it will close down soon, thankfully."
682,what a fiasco. we booked ahead. then had to wait for over 30 min for a van. very limited capacity for pick up drop off. i will never used these guys again. i plan to cancel my return trip as the van is in poor repair and i'm worried for safety reasons. attached picture shows the door being held closed by a seat belt.
683,the repair started out good.  they broke my trunk latch and did not offer to fix it.
684,"they installed a new trane heat pump in july, 2019. december 1, five months later it would not create heat. warranty is one year. cool air today refuse to repair it. i have sent two emails, left two messages. a mother and two children live in the home with no heat. cool air today is operated by the same people who own birk development llc. avoid them!!!"
685,"it's been one year since we had our patio done and i have never, nor will i ever, refer this company to anyone i know. we had a horrible time dealing with the owner, they made gaurentees that were not kept. only one person showed up on time the day of install to prepare the site. the crew completely recked the rest of our yard in the process.

once complete, we were satisfied the job was done on time, but mostly because we were completely exhausted from having to keep on top of the whole project. i ended up taking a day off work to make sure the final color came out exactly has we asked.

in less then one year we began to see cracking and chipping in the color. the sealer lasted no time in this vegas heat! we had no interest in dealing with them or fighting over warranties. we went to home depot to learn how repair and maintain our selves. home depot was great and sent us home with warranties on their products."
686,this was the third time visiting.  the staff was not helpful. they seem clueless about the products that they sell . the repair person was helpful. they replaced the grip but left the covers. i was  a regular at vans and will probably return there
687,the boy who replaced my garage door was very unprofessional. he was argumentative and rude. not only did he talk down to us but we felt the security of our belongings were at risk. i cannot recommenced this company to anyone needing garage door repair / replacement!
688,"i contacted porter roofing because they did repairs on my garage roof twice (8 months between repairs).  randy, the person who did both repairs came out as scheduled and acknowledge the leakages.  he gave me a good impression that he would correct the problem.  i had another appointment and i advised randy to contact my wife who was in the home when he was done.  up on returning home my wife stated randy did not contact her and he left our home about 10 minutes after i did?  ironically, it rained the following day and the leakage had not been repaired!  that was on this past friday and today, monday, i contacted their office and their voice mail box was full and not accepting any messages.  i can't believe there has not been any communication. i should have read their reviews as you are doing now!  this company has communication problems and poor workmanship!  i would not recommend this company based upon my experience and it's amazing how other customers have been treated very similar!  don't do it!"
689,"worst company ever!!! do not use!  they are late for their time slots to show up for your repair and then when they say they have replaced the broken part the in fact do not!!!  we had to call another company to fix what this company didn't fix.  
highly unprofessional appointment scheduler and workers!  lies!!!"
690,one of my most annoying customer experiences ever!!! extremely rude repair man actually came out to tell me he was too lazy to take my job. do not waste your time!!!!
691,my garage door broke on a friday late afternoon and no one would come out except a-1 garage door. that is the only good thing i can say ...the cable had snapped and right away tony the repairman was trying to sell me a brand new garage door opener for $400 and up! he told me my garage door opener was old and if he ordered the part he's not even sure if he could get it and it would break again within 6 months. said if i wanted it fixed right away he would be able to replace the garage door opener with a new one on the spot. i then called my home owners warranty company to see if they would cover it and yes they would cover it.. i tried to arrange for them to use a 1  as the contractor tony told me they were listed as one of the contractors for old republic but guess what ? they were not and he left in a hurry and today my garage door was fixed by vantage garage door in 1 hour a new chain was put up and i was told it would last 25 years so i didn't like a1 trying to sell me a new one and trying to bs me thinking i was desperate on the weekend
692,spencer's does not stand by their product. i purchased a dryer and 1 year later it broke 4 times - the same part. instead of replacing the dryer  they expected me to constantly call the warranty department and take time off of work to stay home for the repairs. 1 or 2 times is understandable but 4 times and the same problem is an inferior product and they should have stepped up and replaced the item. never again spencer's. you lost a customer!!
693,"i give it to this place, every required interaction through my warranty company they see how far my patience can go. they try me every time.

this is my 2 second experience with them, since my summer of 2018 a/c failure (worst experience ever). they were able to repair my hvac eventually after a month. this time around my heater goes out, first american assigns them again. 

to sum up this last visit, it was laughably bad. late appointment, super oblivious to my frustration and follow through was nonexistent.

is this a lot to ask for?!"
694,"this company was referred to us by our home warranty company. we had the ac/heater checked out upon buying our home 11 months ago. the review of our system was excellent then. in the summer, we had an issue with a freon leak. the home warranty company sent out a different hvac company. they repaired the leak issue. in december, we thought we were having an issue and contacted the home warranty company. they sent out absolute air authority, at that time. the repair person who turns out to be the gp of the company, told us that we needed a whole new unit. he also informed us that the unit had never been installed properly and that the last repair company broke the system to the point of disrepair. he told us we would have no ac unit in the summer. he told us we should buy a new unit from him and that of course our home warranty would not cover the cost. we contacted our home warranty company since we suspected that this was not the truth. they sent out another hvac company who confirmed that the unit was in fine shape and did not need to be replaced. how many other people have been told things like this by this company? how many people do not question the statements made by this company? where is the integrity and respect due customers? shame on this company!"
695,"refered by american home shield for duct work repair. clint showed up 1 hour late for the appointment.  didn't check the duct work  but submitted a report that the duct work needed to be upgraded, which is not covered under the policy, so my claim was denied.  very unprofessional."
696,"i took my husband's suit jacket here on august 10 to have a very small hole on the sleeve repaired. see ""before"" photo. lulu quoted $60 and said it would take 3-4 weeks. i paid a $40 deposit. four weeks came and went, and i checked in a few times. she said it would be ready soon. i went in at the beginning of november (3 months later) and she finally admitted that she had lost the jacket, but had just found it. she said it would be ready in the next 1-3 days. it was not. i then had to make a special trip downtown on a saturday to pick it up before she left the country for 10 days. she initially told me to come at noon, then, at 11:44 am, changed the time to 2:00 pm. it was obviously a rush job that day, as you can tell from 2 of the 4 corners in the ""after"" picture. and she still charged me the remaining $20!

i don't know if there are any other reweavers in the area, but if there are, i suggest looking into them."
697,in may of 2015 we contacted our home warranty company because our air conditioner was blowing hot air. they arranged for absolute air authority to come out and repair the a/c. they repaired the a/c quickly. now on june 18th 2016 the same a/c began blowing hot air again. we contacted our home warranty company again and a different company came out on june 19th. they found that the a/c compressor was badly damaged and a new one would have to be installed. they also found an incorrect capacitor was installed. the a/c brand states that a 35 mfd capacitor is necessary and in this case someone installed a 55 mfd capacitor. we were told this could have been the main reason for the compressor to be damaged. the incorrect capacitor was installed by the technician for absolute air authority. i will never use this company again and will suggest that no one use this company.
698,this is the third repair i've had them do for me on properties i own.  most recent one the repair guy tried to charge me $400 to replace a drainage line before even seeing if he could unclog it and then wanted $350 to just dump the water out of the drain pan.  absolute highway robbery.   will not be contacting them for future business.
699,"i like fred and the people he has working for him, i believe the repairs they did are solid, however like another reviewer posted they left me with additional problems do to their work. they replaced a beam on our house and our front porch that was sinking. sadly in the process of lifting the house to replace the beam they bent the door. when i brought this up i was told their is nothing they can do. the door repair guy confirmed it is their error and the only thing to do is either a new door or shave down the new beam. also the finish on our front porch sucks. the brush marks look really bad, and i've shown it to several people that agree. i reached out to fred to get him to look at it and he agreed to come look at it and then never showed, called or emailed. i really wanted to leave a positive review but given the cost of the job and the lack of detail i can't."
700,"have had nothing but issues with this company, you explain why your needing the work done and where you want everything put. they don't listen and they put it where they want to even though you give them the blue print and dimensions of other work i am having done! they damaged the side of my house and have not repaired it. they never compacted the dirt so after it rained the dirt sunk and formed a trench practically. nothing but a huge headache and an ongoing battle. i do not recommend this company, don't waste your money because you'll have to spend more money just to have it fixed"
701,i've been requesting repairs for 6 months and just today i told them i'm not paying my rent until completed. it's pretty quiet and i have no additional complaints.
702,we got a quote from them for a $350 repair that a friend who is a commercial landscaper said should cost less than $100. i don't trust this company.
703,came home early to meet repairman at 300.  calls 345 to  let us know will be another hour.  call 545 to let us know they're not coming.  i guess at least he called.
704,"they are crooked agency trying to hold my deposits hostage. their ""handymen"" painted over mold growing out of the ceiling. i am highly disappointed in their office staff and lies."
705,this review is for the renovation only. now it just looks like another high end steak house. it has lost that unique atmosphere which the palm always enjoyed. sorry....
706,"we took a van of ours to them for a transmission issue and after multiple times trying to fix it we ended up taking it to another company who repaired it properly for $2500 after we had already paid a to z about $2500 to fix it the first time. 

we actually were awarded $1000 on this deal from small claims court but the owner has not paid yet."
707,"ava is a nightmare.
they repaired my dryer, and now it sounds like a cement grinder.
they then took 2 months to get my washer running and now it sounds like an airplane trying to take off. seriously without question the worst company ever."
708,"terrible experience! their technician literally ruined my home when the ceiling came down from a leak in the attic that he refused to check and repair. they also refused to refund my money, this company has zero integrity!  will be reporting this to the bbb. after reading this comment below from tonya, it sounds like penguin is grasping for straws. pictures don't lie and typing up a book of excuses  doesn't help their company look any more honest. they have several bad reviews and i wish i would have read them before i used this sleazy company.terrible experience! their technician literally ruined my home when the ceiling came down from a leak in the attic that he refused to check and repair. they also refused to refund my money, this company has zero integrity!  will be reporting this to the bbb. after reading this comment below from tonya, it sounds like penguin is grasping for straws. pictures don't lie and typing up a book of excuses  doesn't help their company look any more honest. they have several bad reviews and i wish i would have read them before i used this sleazy company.

709,"really awful experience with this company. first, they left very valuable veneer out in the rain and it was damaged beyond use. then, upon re-order, they did not even check to see that the new product was cracked beyond repair. i've been trying to get a refund due to me for 3 weeks. i expected so much more. will never give them my business or any referrals again."
710,"i had previously used the garage door guy for my six rental properties with great success over the last six years.  however the latest job was totally unsatisfactory.  he went out twice to fix a relatively simple repair. after the second time, the garage door literally came off a rail because he did not use the correct parts.  i called another garage door company that stated he did not use the correct size parts for the job.  five hours and $150.00 later the second company had the door working perfectly.  adios garage door guy!!"
711,called day and night for repair hard start was out technician had to call boss to figure out what was wrong cast me $ 378 had same problem 2015 charles roberts  billed me $129 didnt know inflation was so much will  not use them again
712,"this is the perfect example of an inspector not taking responsibility and blaming a buyer. thanks for proving my point yet again.  you continue to point the finger at me even though i paid your husband to be my eyes and find such issues in need of attention.  the seller mentioned in the spds that the tree ""may"" be affecting the wall but your husband did not.  it was my mistake in taking it that since your inspection did not mention it that it was not in need of repair.  i hope my review will help other buyers be more aware."
713,"this is the worst place ever!! we stayed here for a business conference and all i can say is this place is a joke! we are on the 8th floor right next to the renovations. they start construction at 7:00am so don't plan on sleeping in. if they would've told us they were doing this we wouldn't have stayed here! 
also the restaurants are never open their posted hours! if you stay and plan on eating, it won't be here! 
from the time we checked we have been hounded to buy a timeshare by 37 people! it is so ridiculous that we wouldn't go to our room until we absolutely had to just to avoid them! 
we have 1 more night here and i can honestly say i can't wait to leave!
i would not recommend anyone to stay here!"
714,"i used to love panda wok, but it has been closed for almost a year. i would call and for the first 8 months there was no explanation, just a vague ""we'll be closed for a few weeks for renovations."" apparently those few weeks took a lot longer than they thought, because now they are finally coming clean and saying that they'll open in november. too late for me. really? you couldn't be straight with the people who have kept you in business all these years? a great way to lose customers is to frustrate them."
715,the golf courses are small and in need of serious repairs. the batting cages are run down and do not have decent helmets or bats. i can go to funtasticks in tucson and get a better experience than this poop hole.
716,"i requested a quote to repair and/or replace a sprinkler and drip system for a fairly typical 3br family residence in scottsdale - not elaborate.  they came out and produced a quote which i felt was high. 2500 to adjust water pressure and replace/aim 33 sprinkler heads.  2500 to replace the drip system.  i couldn't afford to do it all at once, so i suggested that they could just do the sprinklers and help me out by taking a little time to patch the leaks in the drip.  i got a flat no on what i felt was a reasonable suggestion.  the rep could tell i was disappointed, so he said optimistically, ""we can do the $2500 worth of sprinkler head repair within a day.""

i'm out $100 for the quote, but i'll explore more client friendly options..."
717,"these people are horrible! i've worked with a lot of movers and never had an experience like this. they just broke a large, expensive frame of mine, did a super shoddy repair. it separated on its own a few days after they repaired it. they refused to repair it again. worse, anne who works there acts like i owe owen and her something, how dare i ask them to repare something they broke. i don't usually write reviews, but don't like the thought of businesses thinking they can get away with anything they want so i want to warn others."
718,"do yourself a favor and don't stay here. i stayed this friday night 7-28-17 the check in took 1.5 hrs. my room 359 was disgusting. the bed was very uncomfortable. the room outdated & needs a repairs. the furniture is stained so bad, i put down a towel prior to sitting down. i had to give it 1 star to leave this review"
719,i had a repair job of a half inch copper line that needed to be braised and the line evacuated. they said they couldn't do it.
720,"(update to review: dclc has been in contact with me. i have sent them a quote regarding what it will take to remove just the stain, not remove or repour any concrete or to make any repairs on the parts where i have tried to remove the stain myself to save them some money. i will be updating this again once payment has been received.)"
721,by far the absolute worst branch of pnc in the area. the only thing useful at this branch is the atm's. the problem with this is the drive one is constantly in disrepair. the tellers and bankers inside treat you like a criminal rather than help with simple transactions like a deposit of your paycheck. this is really the worst branch i have ever been to. word to the wise- avoid at all cost.
722,"the a/c in my condo unit at pinehurst was switching off. repairman came out on 4/23/12, and the a/c was working at time. repairman said that there was nothing to be done. larson's charged $39.00 diagnostic fee and left. of course, a/c switched off again. larson's came out on 4/30/12 and found clogged drain line that was causing issue. in addition to repair charge, i was charged diagnostic fee a second time! trevor larson refused to refund fee based on repairman's incompetence."
723,i wish i would of never trusted my repairs with southwest. very unprofessional nothing but the run around. they claim to be there for you as the customer but no that is not how it worked. they just got their money and that was it. i didn't want want to give 1 star because they weren't even worth that.
724,"if you don't speak french don't go here
out of 10 employees 8 don't speak 1 word of english 
they are mean and not friendly . someone should remind them that this is canada not france , o btw market is so old school they are still using old fridges like who knows how many years old i, they need to update this place ,this place needs major renovations .and they need to hire bilingual employees , nuns island has became more and more english speaking place since last 15 years so they need  bilingual employees."
725,"this place has gone downhill since the renovation. it is now douchebag central, and i'm talking about the staff. no longer cool."
726,"i received a quote to fix my vwjettas muffler for $918..alex told me ""hey thats what you get when you buy a volkswagen. .im in waiting room at speedy muffler up the street getting the repair done for $60 out the door..incredible....

so after i posted this review i was sent a msg from customer relations saying they would contact me in 24-48 hours to discuss my experience. .its been over a week..no word from anyone..your batting a 1000 midas"
727,nope .. nope !!!! i couldn't even stay in room. it's out dated.. needs major repairs.  for sure a hooker stop!  booked at excalibur instead for same night . i didn't mind spending more money and be safe.
728,"purchased a dryer in feb. has already stopped working. called for a week straight trying to get a repair man or see if there was anything that could be done. after 8 days spoke to the ""owner"" and was told they don't do repairs and there's only a 30 day warranty."
729,"do yourself a favor and don't stay here. i stayed this friday night 7-28-17 the check in took 1.5 hrs. my room 359 which it cost short of $200.00 was disgusting. the bed was very uncomfortable. the room outdated & needs a repairs. the furniture is stained so bad, i put down a towel prior to sitting down. i had to give it 1 star to leave this review"
730,"i paid my rent on time, however there was an issue with the bank account number. it took them 5 days to contact me to tell me there was an issue with the payment. i have never been late, always round my rent up, and do not cause problems for them. they charged me 205$ in fees even though as soon as i got an email i logged in and made a payment. i am a single mom and asked for a little grace and for them to work with me on the fees owed. the lady at rpm said, ""well it's not like we entered the numbers in wrong, you did. i'm helping you by not making you pay them all today."" i just do not understand why if you know i had money and it was error that i was trying to correct asap that you still needed to have charged me a return fee, legal fee, and 100$ in late fees. i am truly disappointed. 

also when i called and reported a leaking hot water heater it took them 8 days to come in and repair it, however i am charged 200$ plus dollars for a human mistake. :("
731,"called to have goettl give me a quote on some ducting repairs  that i need, they wanted to charge me $80 to come out and evaluate my situation and give me a quote for the work. 

so, i have to pay them to give them a chance to win my business? 

cant speak to the quality of their work, just their business practice and for this i will not use them now or in the future."
732,gave them 3 suits to dry clean and 4 shirts to launder. i had some repair work done on one of the suits years earlier. their dry cleaner managed to open it up and create new tears. never using them again.
733,"if ati handled my cleanup only, would have been 5 stars.  since it has been a year since damage to my townhouse and i am still trying to wrap things up, i feel a little differently about the repairs and accounting end of things..."
734,"i was craving chinese so bad and we went there tonight, but they were closed.  looks like renovations.  maybe a new owner, because it looked like they were changing the name...."
735,"we stayed there 4/7-4/8/17. cabinets and furniture had paint
that was peeling or bleached. bathroom floor was stained and sticky. rug stained and drapes torn. where was the renovation?
you are charged for everything, resort tax $ 34.01 a day. wasn't the room chg a resort charge?
2 cups of coffee and 2 cinnamon buns $ 20.00? i will never go there again."
736,"the trop is finally getting some upgrades and renovations- and it's about time! unfortunately, the inside of the casino is still terribly dated and small, especially with the white washed walls and floors with the red trim and the old old old old yellowy glass ceiling that clashes with everything else. it is however, cleaner than i expected it to be. i came here looking for some cheap games but they are comparable to places like the luxor, which is way more convenient to me, since i stay at mandalay bay whenever i'm in vegas.

this place is old, people, and it has a lot of history, so why not show it some love and respect and give it a proper renovation?"
737,location is great but actual golf area is deceiving from passing by on the street. it is extremely outdated and not very challenging at all. most of the holes were under repair or broken down. an update to the facility would be beneficial to all.
738,"their clock repair tech is very rude, i wanted a repair estimate for my bosses clock and the tech accused me of being cheap, i brought the clock mechanism with out the clock case and he flew off the handle saying i was trying to save money and that i tampered with the clock mechanism. i was told to remove the clock from it's body by the boss and find out what happen. that's what i told the tech, but he wouldn't listen. don't go to m&i. there are other clock repair people who are a lot more friendly."
739,"although this company has purchased the rights to the ""goettl"" name, they are apparently unable to repair the older goettl heat-pumps or air conditioners since they were unable to locate a simple blower motor time-delay relay for my 10-year-old goettl unit."
740,"a couple of years ago, i used this company to manage my fourplex in mesa az. they bilked me out of ten thousand dollars in repairs with only one unit rented. when they took over, i had two portable air conditioning units there which disappeared, costing me another 1,000.00.i feel they were thieves, and likely should be doing time in the local prison."
741,"although this company purchased the ""goettl"" name, it is apparently unable to supply repair parts for goettl equipment. a goettl technician could not locate a replacement blower motor time-delay relay for a 10-year-old goettl heat pump."
742,"got a 12"" turkey on white..the worst sub ever!!!! dry, lack of sauce, extremely salty, very cheap on the ingredients, lettuce is heavy but this is the worst tasting sub and the owner is the same as before.  he is cheap as can be and least generous with the assembly of ingredients.  furthermore, the ingredients are far from fresh.  the bread tastes stale too. some things never change even though the renovation took place.  you'd think things would improve.  far from!! do not go here unless you want to get ripped off."
743,"would give 1 star if it was possible!  this company tried to cheat me out of several thousand dollars in repairs - they said we needed a new compressor.  we got three more opinions because it's like 3k to get a new compressor, and no one else found a problem with it!  when i confronted them about it, the guy, craig, yelled at me!  don't trust these guys at all!!"
744,"do not trust these people had them out to fix ac unit was told it would cost  $1200 dollars to completely go through unit. they charged 360 bucks to replace a diode to get unit up and running that day . next morning unit was dead in the water.this set off red flags and concerns causing me to want a second option called different company there tech found ace air employee had disconnected and tucked the compresser hot lead out of way you did read right tucked out of the way  this was done with intentions of return repair, called to complain and the lady did not seem to be surprised and tried to send out anouther tech to insure the other company really fixed the prob, other company did write a letter to this effect stating what was found, there cost $75.00 to fix ace airs attemp to rip me off!!!!"
745,"horrible! lines always filled ""to the gills"" i can get through faster on a regular check in where i have to unload everything. awful that even after all these renovations they can't get this right!"
746,"mini-golf and driving range. 

neither were impressive. they need to do some serious repairs to both."
747,told me i needed completely unnecessary repair. caution! get second opinion.
748,called larson on a friday because our regular vendor wasn't available. they had a tech out on saturday. the quote was over $1400. said the whole unit needed re-wired. i've never heard of this so i said i would have to get a second opinion. called ami out monday and the repair was $149. that was a few months ago and the ac is still going strong. shame on larson.
749,we received hsa coverage form our realtor when we purchased our new home.  we have been repeatedly disappointed ta the lack of efficiency and repeated denials of expensive home repairs that we are learning now are not covered under hsa policy.  totally worthless coverage.
750,"purchased a new fridge from there, unit was broken within 1 week. lost over $80 of groceries. if i had purchased this from sears of best buy they would have swapped the whole unit out since it was so close to the date of purchase, but these guys just blew me off. now i have to take a full day off work and wait for the warranty repairman to come fix a week old unit. will never purchase through them again."
751,"called duane & asked for some handyman work to be done & he stated he didn't want to ""walk into a hornets nest & fix someone else's screwups."" this was after all i asked about was sanding & reprinting peeling paint on bedroom doors. he was extremely unhelpful & acted as if he wasn't interested in even being hired for any handyman job. do not hire him as he seems very unwilling to actually work."
752,"we were referred to him through american home shield to repair a late model ge electric stovetop.  we opened the ticket on may 5th. by june 19th we just gave up. 

he wasn't able to repair our problem. he wasn't professional or timely."
753,"for such a prime location, it's definitely time for a major renovation crackerjax! it is so run-down, with non-functioning arcade games, & just all-over totally worn-out, ugly, & beat-up."
754,"discourteous, rude people working there. they definitely treat you as if they are doing you a huge favor. took months to get repairs done. they work for the property owners, not for the tenants. they don't give a crap about tenants. any interaction or request for them go fix something seems to frustrate them. they want your money, but don't want to do their job."
755,"i didn't personally have the best experience.  in the end, however, i was re-compensated for the failed repair.  they do seem quite dedicated to customer satisfaction."
756,"update below. 

well ive just got settled into the room and the smoke smell is really bad. ""newly renovated all non smoking rooms"" means nothing when the third floor rooms were all previously smoking. that smell is ingrained into the concrete and studs and every molecule of the structure. no degree of renovation gets rid of it. they are trying to accommodate a move. 
   other than that no real complaints. bed seems decent. place is pretty clean. but the smoke just negates any positive accolades i can leave here.  just don't get a third floor room. i always forget that.

update 7.31.15
  well the air conditioner sucks. a week ad a half ago they had the maintenance guy look at it. a note was left in my room saying something about waiting for a part or a new unit altogether. that was the 19th it's now the 31st and nothing has been sai or done. i've asked a few times about getting a new room and each time they poo poo the idea saying they don't have any vacancies. bullshit. there's no way there at capacity. also, they swapped out a co workers non working fridge with another room. i'm guessing they'll just give that room with the broke fridge to the next customer. 
   long story short, the candlewood where some coworkers were previously is a much better place."
757,"zero stars! loser, liars,scoundrels! stayed in one of their properties. they ripped us off for a supposed 1000$ bill. we moved out and repainted and patched up holes. said they had to repaint and repair walls. had paint matched to repaint. liars! the owner is a douchebag scumbag liar. took too long for mgmt to return calls, had to get things fixed on our own then beg to have things rent deducted. dont be a fool and rent from these liar scumbag scoundrels"
758,"wow those ads sure are great. they sucked us in. when the rep came i was impressed. he was early, professional and courteous. when he told us our older ac unit would need extensive maintenance (it still works), we figured it wouldn't hurt to check out pricing for new units. checking out pricing turned into an hour and a half ordeal and when we told him we were never planning on purchasing a new unit that night something snapped in him.  he started getting combative and asking us why over and over again. we had to ask him to leave. it's really a shame because our experience was great up until that point.  now reading other reviews i think we will get a second opinion on the repairs too. i almost feel bad for their employees as it must be a hard sell environment.  this is especially hard when the product you are selling is so much higher than everyone else's and there doesn't appear to be an apparent difference."
759,"well, kyle was supposed to repair our hot tub and provided a quote for approx. $1200 to rebuild the motors, he immediately asked for $600 deposit which he received, then  he brought the two rebuilt motors and installed them, however the installation was shotty with power cables hanging loose, we called him to fix it and he did, however then we discovered that there are leaks from the pumps he installed, we asked him again to come and repair it but he said he won't do it unless he gets paid first, which we don't feel comfortable paying until the job is done to our satisfaction.   needless to say we have to find another repairman and the job has been dragging on for a couple of weeks."
760,"since i used this co for a different project a few wks ago i figured i'd give them a try and see about getting my kitchen countertops redone so i gave them a chance. the owner showed up with samples of stuff for me to view and said he'd contact me the next day with info on my selection. well, he didn't & after i finally got ahold of him i found out that he was showing me samples of stuff that wasn't available. he then got moody & started an unprofessional text session w/me givin bs excuses while trying to justify his incompetence. sadly i'm glad he behaved so poorly because that probably saved me from more crappy work. the other job i used this co for was some outer wall repair (drywall & stucco work), well it's already cracking and looking like it needs reworking. i would thought for what i paid it'd at least last a bit longer before falling apart. these co has problems with keeping their schedules & word, providing accurate details and lasting quality, not good business."
761,"terrible contractor who will not complete the job.  i waited for two months for repairs to a patio, roof and fence damaged in a storm. the ""scheduling"" was performed by constant lying, i.e. ""the paperwork must have gone to a junk email account"".   i must have talked to them a dozen times but they still wouldn't start the work."
762,"what kind of handyman want's you to take a picture of a job before giving a bid.?????

lazy.!!!!!!!"
763,"they have no idea what's going on, like ever!  stay away from this company.  even their repairman was venting about what a horrible company they are!  and now i see why! there are so many other companies that do a great job!  go with them and save yourself the frustration!"
764,"answer from 
comment from rudolf v. of silver desert handyman 
business owner 9/10/2018  mr. paka, 
thanks for posting review ! what kind of handyman ask picture? good handyman does that , a picture is wort of thousnad words.
have a good day.

true pictures worth a thousand words... but not on a job.!!!! a pictures will only show you what want the pictures see... pictures don't show hiding things... than you will be asking for more money or you be doing a bad work.!!!!!

 rudolf v. of silver desert handyman 
get off your fat ass and do your job right.!!!!! put your trust in a man who is lazy.!!!!"
765,brought in a $25 purchased ebay clock to get fixed. agreed to a quote of $17 and told to wait 20 minutes. walked up later and handed over a $20 for the 15 minutes of work. repair guy asks where's the other $50? tough way to make a living...
766,this place needs a major renovation. atleast replace the bulbs!
767,"do not join this horrible club!!! they offer you a 3 day evaluation period and once you find the club in horrible disrepair with old broken equipment and dirty conditions that aggravate allergies, they refuse to refund the full amount. 

they basically stole $70 from me. don't let it happen to you. there are much better gyms all over the area."
768,"i beg to differ when it comes to the term ""friendly"".  i'm usually in there at night & when i ask where a certain item is, you'd think i was asking them for their wallet.  maybe once the renovations are complete it will be easier to find things, especially the advertised specials.  or you can ask for a raincheck & get the old eye-roll & ""damn, where's my pen"" look."
769,will never use them again. horrible work. cost me more to repair things they didn't do right. things were started and never completed. was told my list would be done in three days. over a week later and nothing is finished and i'm having to look for someone else to fix all of the issues that this company caused. extremely disappointed.
770,"crew was late the day repair work was scheduled to be done.  additionally, because they did not take before and after pics of the work they did and i was at work i have no idea if they fixed anything other then the tiles.  we had two leaks that were the reason for the work.  unless you are ok with taking someone's word they did the work, stay clear of anyplace that doesn't provide proof."
771,i went to there yesterday night.  they closed for renovation. .some one know when they will reopen again  ?
772,"has been closed since the week of thanksgiving, due to ""renovations."" still not open as of  01/13/2015. i drive past this place at least once a week around 7:30 pm. perhaps if i drove earlier in the day, i might see construction or lights on showing that someone is still around, doing something.

but i doubt it."
773,"i would not recommend this company to anyone. mike was supposed to be over to repair my roof at 10am, so i took the morning off to be able to be there. he called at exactly 10am the morning of to say he wasnt going to be able to make it. so unprofessional and disrespectful of my time."
774,hsa home warranty is horrible. will not cover furnace repair even though furnace is in contract. fighting with the company right now.
775,"do not stay here!!  so, my journey to this pit of the earth began by them assigning me a room that can complete with no furniture and a painter who was painting the room.  next room had not been used in some time and the a/c was completely broken.  third room had mold on the baseboards and was adjacent to a room being renovated.  just as an fyi renovations at this ""resort"" start at 8am.  so imagine trying to do a conference call with banging so loud that your customer is complaining about it.  forth room is so far from the conference center that they recommend i call for a shuttle.  this place is a complete joke and should be avoided like the plague.  hilton should sell this property."
776,"i had a very positive initial experience with them. however about a month into the new hot water heater it leaked, then died.  no hot water for three days. then the issue was more then they thought and had to order a part.  after two weeks i called and was told they should be able to do it next week. really. i don't get the fact no one called me and i am chasing you down to actually refurbish a brand new hot water heater. now i am scheduled to have the ""new"" hot water heater fixed next week.  mind you i am about $1600 in for this new now refurbished, but jerry-rigged hot water heater that is missing the element to stop it from burning up.  not happy, actually ticked off here in summerlin. i would not reccommend them based on the lack of communication and inability to repair the hot water heater. let alone leaving it in a condition that if it runs to hot would not be able to turn it self off."
777,"we checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like, moldy ceilings,  musty smells, unclean rooms, and such a huge renovation job it should be shut down or discounted by 99%! thank god hotwire gave us a refund."
778,technician was not knowledgeable about the insteon smart switches that i called to have them repair even though they said they were sending out a knowledgeable technician.  they had to make two trips at a cost of $400 to replace a a $40 light switch!  bottom line...i paid $400 for on the job training.  lesson learned. people were very nice but i won't be using them again.
779,"so disappointed in this business, i brought my riding boots in over a month ago with a tear in the leather. i was not sure if they could even be fixed, but they assured me that they could "" do something"" so, i left both my boots. well, i picked up my boots today and it looked like a second grader had repaired them.  it is peeling, just horrible work.  would not recommend"
780,"this place is a joke. after spending $4k at this place, the bed and couch fell apart. bot even 4 months of owning the bed it started breaking. called on the warranty and they didnt help at all. so i had to make the repairs to it myself and make it way more stable than when purchased. than not even a year later the couch we bought from them broke. called about the warranty and yet again no help. so i am going to have to fix this myself. if you want cheaply made furniture than this is your place."
781,"my home warranty company sent these idiots into my home for a plumbing issue. they told me the warranty company wouldn't cover the repair, they then quoted me an outrageous price to fix the problem. had my regular plumber fix it at a reasonable price. then i find out the warranty company probably would have covered the repair. can't recoup my money because i didn't use one of their shoddy contractors!"
782,"i have a rental property where the tenant contacted me about a burst pipe with a lot of water in the bathroom and down the hall.  i called roto-rooter for the repair.  i was quoted a price for water remediation of about $1500 not including the actual plumbing repair.  i was billed almost twice that amount.  i contacted the guy that did the work and his explanation was ""there was additional that needed to be done"".  he promised me a copy of the invoice several times and i have yet to receive.  i have been given nothing except the run around."
783,"update debra was fired i was paid $2,000 for housing discrimination they are on a 3-year suspension for housing discrimination it's public record i don't live there no more am i understanding they still repairs"
784,"get a second and third quote.  they said i needed a new furnace and ac.  not true the ac needed repair. 
which was the difference between 1200 dollars well spent to 5400 wasted.  

red tagged furnace due to cracked heat exchange, 2nd opinion turned out to be your unit looks new and is operating well below saftey standards.  also this part was under warranty. and a repair would have cost a fraction of what a new unit would have.

old refrigerant r22 not rechargeable and unit needed replacing. turns out to be rechargeable and the kicker my unit has new refrigerant.  the unit had a sticker indicating this of course.  

downloaded yelp app to warn others as i didn't see any reviews. my units were 7 years old and was told they were old and outdated. dont rush a decision.  thank goodness it was a comfortable season.  and neither heat nor air were required. it took less then 24 hours to setup another quote and diagnosis."
785,"my ac stopped working so i called them for a repair. not only did the guy charge me but when he left it still was not working. i called today to just state that it still is not working and travis @ larson air said someone would be out by 3 pm to fix it. i waited an hour then called to say no one showed up and he told me the tech quit. ok, i re-arranged my work schedule to come home early so i told him the professional thing to do was to let me know that no one was going to show up!! i asked him when a tech could get out here and he told me 2 weeks. i will never call them again!!! not only did they charge me but the problem was not fixed and they expect me to wait 2 weeks!!!"
786,was told a bid will be email to me but never recieved.  no follow up even after i texted  for a bid to be emailed to me for roof repair
787,they quoted me 1900 for repairs after telling me over and over that i need a new ac.  i got another quote and got my ac fixed for less than 400 dollars.  these people are scammers and prey on people who don't know when they are getting robbed.  would never do business with them again.
788,"i lived here for 2 years and went through 6 staff groups, one not any better than the last.
for over a year the parking stall light were never repaired, my daughter and i didn't feel safe walking around at night.
we had roaches, we stopped using their bug guy because it wasn't working.
this staffs attitudes are so  unprofessional.  
don't move here, stay away."
789,"we initially were happy with some straight forward repairs early in the warranty, but they started making up rules that were not written in their policy. they also charge $50 to cancel the policy that is not also in their policy. they stated it is our company policy, but nothing in the policy documentation we had."
790,"this is how levins expedited repairs work (after complaing to the manager jerry) .  levin has eventually recieved the replacement part (that could also be purchased on amazon with 2 day prime shipping) unfortunately they can't have a repair person before jan 4 to my house, no time frame, just a date i have to set a side a full day and wait for the repair person, and you can't say no jan 4 doesn't work as the next available date is almost 3 weeks later!!!!!!!!!!! no wonder levin gives a 1 year warranty, they only need to repair their crappy furniture once before the warranty runs out.  thanks for selling me an item that broke within 3 days and make me wait 3, three months to have a repair man scheduled to repair it."
791,get your picture taken with the million dollars! it's free. otherwise run while you can... this place is in dire need of a renovation.
792,"navid bakshi and his realtor company las vegas real estate specialists was hired to manage one of our condominiums. everything went well for a year or 2 but it became a nightmare. they started sending us bills for property damage repairs that were obviously and ridiculously overpriced. he fixed a draw with tape and provided us an invoice for $125. a loss garage opener replacement that should have been charged to the tenant was charged to us for $100. several small house repairs amounted for a total of approximately $5000 (none of which we were notified in advanced for). 

long story short, we felt that navid bakhshi and his company poorly managed our property that cost us more than it should have. i highly recommend to avoid any business with these guys"
793,i took a small piece of luggage in for repair. it seemed like a simple fix to repair a l shaped tear in vinyl.  super glue would have worked but decided to let a professional do it after all they do advertise luggage repair. i have several pieces to the set.  it was terrible!  the owner was embarrassed to say the least of the job. he said he would put a patch of leather over it and another patch to match on the other side.  they couldn't even get that right. the patches were not the same size!  stay away for repair. this work was just plain awful. my luggage is trash!
794,"if only zero was an option... grrrr...

bought a brand new ac unit from these folks a few years ago. every year since, it has needed repair. only once has the repair been covered under warranty. the ac was clearly a piece of citrus, and i don't mean an orange! 

call anyone but these shysters!"
795,"i would never go here for repairs! they make promises they cannot deliver but offer no refunds. i brought in my trimmer and had them look at it to see if it could be repaired or if i should buy a new one. they said it could be repaired and it would be less than $100 so i paid the deposit. after two weeks i had to call them and they said it was beyond repair and they would not refund my deposit. the guy repeated multiple times that they had a ""policy"" of no refunds regardless of the outcome. i think they use this ""policy"" often to get more money. now my only option is to buy a new one but they won't even apply my charge to a new trimmer. they are not honest!"
796,"got this bull message that they want to charge me $75 for a piece of plastic tracking that they glued and didn't even replace as part of my byannual inspection. this company is such a ripoff! will be posting a picture of the letter and the piece of plastic they glued in yelp later.
we had no ac for 5 days in over 100 degree weather, tick infestations, a broken fence that was never repaired properly, squatters in the home when i moved in, repairs that were never completed properly, junk that was never removed in my home and yard properly, a giant hole in the wall behind our refrigerator, etc. invitation holes has a long history of all sorts of horrible rip offs and lack of repairs: you can find detailed info about this slum lord on the group tenants of invitation homes. do not rent from this company!!!"
797,"expensive. left my audio receiver for a diagnostic revision, they called me 2 hours later saying it was already repaired and the bill was 128 dollars. ouch."
798,"every time i've needed to call, i am on hold for at least 30 minutes.   this is completely unacceptable.  my dryer broke in august, and despite several repairs, it is still not fixed.  it is almost february."
799,horrible place filled with horrible people. was quoted 15k for a repair that cost less than $100. don't trust these scammers
800,"renter be aware that you will receive little or no help with major issues. the property that i rented from them was extremely dirty when i moved in. grease all through the kitchen and cabinets. it took three days to clean the house before i could unpack the truck. they said that they were going to repair the landscaping and the sink holes. never happened. do not believe a word they say. i lived there for 18 months and gave them over $20,000 in rental. when it was time to move out they made sure that they got my security deposit and turned me into collections for the difference? i left their house in better condition than when i moved in. they charged me $380.00 for a 1"" plastic mini blind that costs $4.95 at wall-mart. renter be aware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
801,"shameful behavior-awful experience
we have a home warranty policy that covers our hot water tank. however, two of the pi technicians decided to tell us that we needed a part not covered under our policy. after talking with our agent, we decided to get a 
second opinion, in this case really a third opinion.
well, the new technician was able to repair our hot water system in 5 minutes. we never needed that $825 part. 
beware! smh"
802,"i had a repairman at my house today to check our units. they are both older units and we were aware that there were a few problems. we were not aware of everything that was pointed out to us. we were not sure if we wanted to just fix our units for now or replace our units completely, it's a big decision. the pressure sale was on to do something today. when we decided not to act today and think about it there was irritation in my repairmans demeanor. on top of that i'm not sure how it happened but my vents have been blowing out insulation all over my house since he was here, i've never had that happen before with any other company that has been to my house. i'm very disappointed. when we decide to do something with our units it won't be with patrick riley."
803,"10/06/2015 i made a call to inform them that i had a roof leak the evening of 10/05/2015. it's now 10/30/2015 and i still can't get an answer as in when the roof and inside the town home will be repaired. i've called and sent emails and still can't get an answer or date.
one word to describe how this place is managed "" horrible """""
804,this company inspected the hvac system on a home we were selling. i had a minor repair done on the furnace which i looked up and the internet listed it as a quick diy repair. he also strapped up a couple ducts and taped the seams. i know there were not many ducts left to repair because i spent  half a day strapping and taping almost every duct line. charged $459 crazy expensive for what was done.
805,"apparently a lot of other people posting reviews for the response crew had dramatically different experiences than we did. seems odd, to say the least. 

thankfully the red flags were crystal clear when they sent scott to our home to give us an estimate. the simplest repairs were made complicated and conveniently required other repairs that were not only not necessary, but we did not want them. in addition to trying to complicate and expand simple repairs, he was quite adamant about finding other repairs that, again, were not necessary, and we did not want or ask for them. the experience was like we had invited a pushy salesman into our house. in addition to this, when we mentioned we had a good plumber for our plumbing problems that we were very happy with scott felt obliged to insult our intelligence, not to mention denigrating our plumber and plumbers in general, by trying to convince us how much better the response crew were and seemed to be suggesting plumbers charged too much and were not to be trusted. see the irony here?"
806,"arizona fog wizards installed my misting system when my house was being landscaped. that was four years ago. ovr that time, i have needed repairs performed every year as part of system starter. this year, i have contacted arizona fog wizards two times to attempt to get repair for my system and they simply do not return my calls. i think this used to be a very good company, but things seem to have fallen apart in the last year or two. i'll be contacting a different company now to see if they can help me out."
807,"some guy from this place dropped in to my work without an appointment demanding to speak to the maintenance staff. since the maintenance staff was out of the building i spoke to him, since i oversee the business. he asked about the parking lot of the business, and knowing that the business does need some asphalt replacement, told him to go ahead and give me an estimate. 
he left the estimate on my desk. then followed up with an e mail. i reviewed the estimate and found it to be significantly higher than others we have gotten in the past, so didn't bother to respond to his e mail. he then called me later in the day asking about it so i was honest and told him that it was higher than the other estimates. he then became angry stating that the estimate was not high and something about the company's inability to afford it. then stated i should fire my maintenance director for the condition of the parking lot (uh, the parking lot is over 30 years old, and my maintenance director is not responsible, nor able to do such a repair which is why i permitted him to give me an estimate. i knew that when we had it done, it would need to contracted out). then he states, ""thanks for wasting my time"" and hung up! excuse me sir, you walked into my business unannounced and without an appointment and i gave you an opportunity to earn my business and you're blaming me for wasting your time?! 
extremely rude and unprofessional. even if he was the least expensive, i would not use this company!"
808,"avery scott showed up to our business for a faucet that wouldn't stop running. rude. he ""diagnosed"" the problem as the faucet won't stop running. yeah we know, thats why we called. he wanted $79 for that 5 minutes of his time. price to repair the cold side of the faucet, $298, both hot and cold, $452, replace the $100 faucet, $692. what a joke."
809,"in my case, the company took no responsibility for installing their product over existing bad plumbing.  i knew before they put the product down, it would be a problem...yet when i tried to tell them about it, i was told there would be no problem.  i even started noticing a problem after the installation and tried to mention something, but this was received by deaf ears.  it's now come time to repair the pipe underneath the floor, and they are still not taking responsibility for the problem that could have been avoided had they recommended me to fix the pipe before installation.  i brought the matter to the bbb and i was basically called a liar and slandered by the company.  i will never ever use nature stone again and i will tell my friends to avoid them like the plague."
810,"brought a pair of ankle boots to be repaired ... wore 3x's & both soles that were replaced came off, terrible workmanship, wasted $45.00 ... will never return ... 1-star is too much !
jr"
811,i've used this company in the past and they did a good job for me but this time i had another repair and instead of sending a person to repair five tiles of mine that come undone at the peak of my roof they sent one of the owners.  he didn't even fix the tiles and told me that you can't walk on them or you'll break them and tried to sell me a new roof.  so i just went down to home depot got the supplies went on my roof and fixed it myself and didn't break any tiles walking on them.
812,"not very ""friendly"" 
there are many repair businesses in las vegas. stay the hell away from this one."
813,"my a/c went out but it is under warranty with the manufacturer.  ace came out and wanted to sell me a new unit and were very very persistent that it would really be the only good way to fix this.  since warranty covers the compressor and fan controller, i would only need to come up with the 2000 dollars to cover the labor and refrigerant.  2 months later it is broken again.  the same tech came out and again tried to sell me a new unit since mine is after all 8 years old.  i told him no and he told me it was the expansion valve which is also covered under warranty.  but,, i would need to pay for the 2000 dollars in labor and refrigerant again.  i have lost faith in this company to do ethical business since i am sure this was the original problem and should have been fixed the first time.  they just want to sell new units.  repairs should be handled with another company."
814,"this place should not be part of the hilton brand. i had someone book this for us for my daughter sleep over. the kids were so disappointed with the rooms, it's old and desperate need of a renovation. i failed to look at the reviews and trusted the brand. never again."
815,"buyer beware! i bought couch and extended warranty (that covers nothing) and 18 months later it is falling apart and neither  company nor warranty company will help.  i got the run around and final answer was ""that is wear and tear, so it wont be covered"" .  salesman swore ""anything happens and they will fix or repair, no problem"""
816,"tried to get them to come do a repair & they no called, no showed twice this week. nope! don't have time for that."
817,"i have been a customer for 12 plus years and the controller board has gone out a few times on my goettl 13 see unit.  the cost in the past was around 400-500 bucks.  this past summer it went out again not long after my ""gold key"" pre summer inspection.  the technician said it is normally ~1600, but since i was a member they could do it for $14xx.00 .  i was caught off guard since the same board has been way less than a $1000 in the past.  i told the technician i could not afford that and he said he could re-wire the system to keep it running for the summer, but the heat portion of the heat pump would not work.  the charge for that was a little less than 500.  i reluctantly paid it since my other option was no a/c in the middle of the summer.  i later contacted another ac repair company who did the work for $400.00 . which tells me the fact that i bought my unit from them and had the fee based membership meant nothing.  the company does not get my endorsement.  they only want my money. how is it possible for them to justify over $1000 more than another company?  greed."
818,bought a 2017 accord hybrid. was supposed to be honda certified. have been waiting 6 weeks for repairs promised with the purchase. so many lies... wow. two or more calls each week with empty promises. sad way to do business.
819,"another prime example of why this complex has such a low rating.

ac went out this afternoon, and i called the emergency maintenance line. they came out relatively quick, but because they were not the normal maintenance staff, they could not get the ladder they needed from the maintenance storage, and was not able to fix my ac.

what's good of having someone on call for emergency maintenance when they can't access the proper tools?!?!?

now i'm sitting here, sweating my ass off and waiting for a repairman to come. 

thanks again papago crossing."
820,i never did receive a response from the company. i contacted a handyman to place the handle that delta  sent for free in the mail. plumbing innovations could have requested the same handle and installed it at another visit if they were a reputable company.  i had to pay  $50 out of pocket to have it installed just wanted to show the finished work
821,"if i could give hsa a -100  stars i would...make sure before you pay the $75 fee you read every part of the hsa warranty.  nothing is covered...my dishwasher broke....not covered because it's a bracket.  my ice maker in my refrigerator broke....surprise surprise they don't cover that either.  i paid another $75 for a roof repair....guy never even showed up, said he did and they wont return my money....biggest scam i've ever seen.  beware!!!"
822,"it is 117 degrees and our upstairs air conditioning unit is not working. my home warranty gave the job to buenos aires. they do not schedule a specific time. instead, they give a four hour time period from 12-4pm. so they call at 4pm and tell us that apparently their tech is too incompetent at his job and will not be making it to our house and tells us that they can try to reschedule us for tomorrow. if you cannot hit a four hour period and are not even sure if you can hit a 24 hour time period, maybe you should realize that you are too incompetent for the job! calling my home repair company to get a new company,  i will not use someone who takes it lightly that people are without air conditioning when it is over 110 degrees! worst company ever! if i wasn't going through the warranty i paid for i would just call one of the actual reputable hvac companies in las vegas!"
823,"it seems the decisions made by berryhill are based more on race than an applicants merit. a friend of mine recently applied for a less than stellar duplex. he was denied due to a low credit score, but no consideration was made to the fact the his credit union had just pulled his credit (& approved him) for something else!?! obviously, his credit was decent!! he had money to pay all the necessary fees, deposit & rent for 2 months in advance. he has a stable job, an outstanding reputation @ the company he works for, & no rental history!!! there was absolutely no reason why he should've been denied!! he's also a handyman on the side, so i'm sure he would've been able to make the property look 10 times better than the way it does now (def needs sum tlc)...
many of the people who know him were floored by the fact that he wasn't given a chance, so the general consensus is that the denial was because he's african american...
either way, it's definitely berryhill's loss!!!"
824,"the worst "" handyman"" ever!!!!    destroyed over $200.00 of my property!!!  to say the job was shockingly amateurish would be a astronomically understated.  never hire this company."
825,"one of the worst places to do business with. my poor mother called the company and had thad come through and did repairs on the ac unit on monday the 17th and not even 4 days pass and on the 21st the ac unit broke down again. i called him up and he came over to tell me that the ac unit is beyond repair. so he charged my poor mother $400 for work that wouldn't even sustain the ac unit, what was the point of the repairs? taking advantage of people to make a quick buck? very unprofessional and could not even give straight answers. terrible place and wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
826,"i really hoped this would be a nice outing for my nephew while he was here. it was ok, but just ok. many of the animals were ""not currently on display"" and most attractions, shows, etc. were closed. the ones that were open, sting-ray bay, trolley ride, etc. you had to pay more to participate. seems a little steep since we had already paid $30 for one adult and one child's ticket. zoo itself is in a mediocre state of repair. a frozen lemonade was almost $6! unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, i would suggest you skip this ""gem""."
827,"a complete dump.  where's the dynamite?  shower had mildew in the grout, everywhere i looked the place is run down and in disrepair.  staff had robotic disengagement.  old growth timber here.  never again."
828,"this company replaced the ac system on our rental property and poked holes in the brand new roof and refused to claim responsibility, therefore i had to pay the roofing company out of our own pocket to repair it and ensure my roof warranty did not become void."
829,"what an awful company! how can these people sleep at night being this shady?! my mother was quoted 15k for a repair that cost less than $100! this company is sketchy, and that technician named mike that works there is a liar! don't trust these bunch of con artists!"
830,"had them put on a new roof for us.  it has leaked now 3 times in 2.5 years, and they have been either slow to respond or unresponsive to our calls to have it repaired under their warranty.  lack of response has created ceiling damage, to which they also have not responded in our request to fix."
831,"as someone in their review said if there was a lower number, i would give it. i bought my couch 6 months ago, at from 5 months the repairman was here saying the material had pulled away from the frame. this caused my friend to sink when she sat down.. again, i repeat five months. also you can see the netting that holds the fiber in the material.
i hope that this thursday things will be different! will update!"
832,completely unhappy. had this company go out to repair one of my garage doors while i was out of town. they got to home over 1 hr late and used their high pressure sales tactics on my wife. when they realized that wasn't going to work guy got rude and rushed through things with her. my wife knowing something was off went ahead and called another company. they came out and replaced 2 parts $50 and we were good. this was few months ago. still zero issues. c&m told us we needed to spend over $900 just in parts to fix our issue or door would never work again. liars! i would not use this guys for anything.
833,"called this company to come out and give me an estimate for my balcony repair.  they made an appointment to come out.  they called me 2 hours prior to appointment time to tell me they couldn't touch my townhouse.  i must call a ""roofing contractor"" instead.  they are listed as a roofing contractor according to a google search.  don't waste your time, like they wasted mine."
834,i took my sons playstation 4 to  get repaired. they said they would look at it  and if they could fix it would be $89 if they couldn't it would be free & they would call me as soon as they knew . i thought that was very fair. 1 week passed & no one called me so i called to follow up & they said that they were short handed & as soon as they look at it then they would call me. 2  1/2 weeks go by so a total of 3 1/2 weeks now they have  it. so my husband decided to call & they said they fixed it & it would be $89 it is ready to pick up. so my husband goes down to pick the fixed playstation that same day. to end up being told that they couldn't fix it. what? 3 1/2 weeks for them to do nothing? wow !!!!
835,never use this company. one year parts and labor on a under the slab plumbing repair that cost me all most $3500. you have got to be kidding!
836,"the dim sum is just average at best. i am chinese so i know dim sum! it doesn't compare to a san fran or ny or even my local oriental east in the dc area.  i wasn't expecting much from the other reviews, but thought i would give it a chance.  the decor is lacking any luster very dated and needs renovation quick!"
837,"ckbr continues their shenanigans! they finished our bathroom renovation over a month ago. it took six and a half months to complete a job they estimated would take 4-6 weeks. they lied! and the worse part is they continue to lie and mislead. several of their current customers have contacted me with the same complaints. i have complete communication logs to prove their deceptions. since i was drawn in my their slick home & garden presentation, and by their internet reviews, i feel obligated to warn others on those same platforms. to say the least, i cannot recommend this company."
838,"well, it's only a few months (less than 5) since walker ""repaired"" my couch.  and it's cracking and peeling again.

what a waste!  

do not buy from walker furniture!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
839,would not recommend it at all.  horrible results. so bad had to go to another salon to fix it. no confidence in them to repair the mess they made.  results are embarrassing. hate to be seen like this.
840,"this is a ""resort"" in need of complete renovation. do not pay more than $50 per night for a room here. we left as soon as we could book another spot."
841,guess what.... electric recliner that was repaired broke again!!!!! not looking forward to dealing with them again
842,made an appointment with chiris to repair and refinish a leather sofa. no show . called him 1 hour after his scheduled time and had to leave a message.  never returned our call. hard to believe people run a business like this!!!! (could not give 0 stars)
843,"had warranty repair from chas roberts through fulton homes.  on a side note fulton homes quality is a joke.  chas roberts is no different, just as low quality as fulton homes.  came out to fix something 4 times and it's still not fixed right.  low quality work done by inexperienced tradesman."
844,"i was never offered anything, there was no issue with settling.  i was insulted, called names, and treated rudely when i called to have the seam repaired.  i stand by my truthful review.  bad business practices have dogged this company for years, read the reviews.  the better business bureau has been notified of this fraudulent company, and they are handling it from here.  mr falls, may god help you, you are a liar."
845,"today is the sixth month anniversary of our signing with ckbr for a master bath renovation that was estimated to take 4-6 weeks. nothing has been done in three+weeks and we still do not have a counter top for our vanity, faucets and fixtures for the sinks and showers, plumbing attached and working, lights moved and installed, or mirrors. frankly, the end is not in sight and all we have is promises for completion...some day. i can not recommend ckbr, and sad they have put me in this position."
846,"was assigned this company on a friday from my home warranty for my freezer malfunctioning. they called on monday - 3 days later as they don't work weekends. they also only work 9am-5pm for repairs. this is not acceptable for those of us who have to work to pay our bills. when i asked the agent to notify my home warranty that they couldn't process order due to inflexible hours, the agent became very rude and told me i should call the warranty company to tell them."
847,"took 2 eureka windtunnel vac's in for cord replacement and tuneup.

great job replacing the cords however, both vac's were now running the agitator brush all the time. i can not get them turned off. owner said that will happen and the repair is big bucks. ok, they were not stuck on when i brought them in."
848,"edit: complete crooks. put $20k into both trucks. one of the owners is a complete cheat. 

love these guys! true, we bought 2 trucks that have needed lots of $$$ in repairs, but we got a good deal on the trucks in the first place, and these guys have been more than willing to help where they can. they are getting out of the truck selling business, but they still sell toy haulers & trailers. go see them for a good deal."
849,"closed!!! maybe you guys should update!!! worthless! it's fucking literally 110 degrees at 720pm and you're closed ""for repairs""! get a grip!"
850,"i wasn't surprised with what i found with the other review. i had a leak in an external filter that took literally 5 minutes to fix, with $5 in parts. they wanted $240 for it. luckily my manager called me first before letting them go ahead with the repair. i ran to home depot, spent $5, and took 5 minutes to fix the problem. 

i would advise against calling them- very lacking in business ethics!"
851,"im hoping the second company my home warranty people send out are better than this company. tech came out to look at garbage disposal. i showed him where the housing unit was cracked and leaking. he never turned on unit, took 2 pictures of unit and left. 1 week later i call to see about repair. im told they preformed a clean out and removed a spoon from disposal.no mention of crack/leak. home warranty stands by their report. now we wait, im not encouraged as i checked reviews of new company, not much better than this one."
852,they told me i needed 400 dollar repairs and took it somewhere else and there was nothing wrong. i think they are shady and untrustworthy! don't go to this location!!
853,this company will roof your home but when it's leaking everywhere they say they don't do roof repairs.  i have a tw lewis custom home in a 17 home gated community and over half of us have leaking roof issues and specialty roofing says they don't do roof repairs. so basically they put on a roof and will not repair it when it's leaking. eventually a lawyer and a group of homeowners will sue them for faulty construction.
854,initially venetian outdoors did a great job but when we needed a repair done they continually put me off and have ignored my emails and calls. the repair was to be done at our expense and the damage was caused by a dog but the complete lack of interest in helping us repair a simple seam leads me to believe that i should not recommend this company to anyone else. there are lots of companies who will install artificial turf in the phoenix metro area. just find one that is more interested in repeat business and referrals and you may be better off.
855,"run, don't walk from this company.  beware of its' owner donnie o'neal.  after his quoting repair work and my purchasing over $300 of parts for him to install he never showed up on the date he said he would do the installation.  in fact, i never ever heard from him again.  even after i made repeated attempts to contact him via voice mail, text messages and requesting on his website to contact me."
856,"if only 0 stars were an option... ray, who is volt inc., came out to fix our wine fridge last week, gave us an incorrect diagnosis, took and cashed our check, and that's the last communication we've had. we've called and sent texts because the fridge is still broken (his insistence that it isn't cooling because of dust buildup apparently wasn't the problem since his so-called repair consisted of vacuuming behind the fridge)--no response at all. he (volt) has even blocked our calls. i wish i checked the reviews here. lesson learned."
857,not thrilled with the fact that the bed that i bought my groupon deal for does not operate correctly.  the hydraulic system is broken.  i had to manually hold the lid up.  when i asked out repairs the clerk was more into up selling me lotion or upgrading my package.  it was only $15 so really no great loss.
858,"note: i visited the garden in july of 2016. the chinese garden was closed and they where doing major renovation. so we heard chainsaw throughout our visit.

as a local, i know how superb this place can be. opulent flowers, gorgeous trees, zen garden everything to feast your eyes on.

but i was so disappointed! only the green houses exhibition where good."
859,"a month ago, he repaired my ac with a guarantee for 1 year. after only 1 month, it stops working, i called him three times and he has never returned my call. i had to hire another company to re-repair the work i already paid him for."
860,"they delivered my refrigerator,  did not correctly had ok it up and caused water damage and flooding in the basement. they are refusing to pay fir the repairs. do not use them"
861,"since the last post there have been some improvements. 

two days after the post the security light on the porch was finally fixed. more recently they have started to notify us before they turn off the water for repairs. the manager herself has been very helpful and approachable. 

still waiting for the window and entry tile to be repaired, but overall things have improved. 

will keep potential renters updated."
862,"this frys is in desperate need of a renovation. the lighting is dark, the aisles are narrow, and what's worse the produce is terrible. i would love to see this place updated because it is so convenient for my family. in the meantime we travel to a further location to get the quality this locations lacks."
863,"for the westin, this place stinks, literally.  when i walk in the room(s), it has that very musky smoked in room.  the bar downstairs is good though, always happening.  if i wasn't such an spg points whore, i would never stay here.  word is that they will be getting a renovation soon...it is sorely needed."
864,"terribly worn tuxedo, wrinkled and bunched up tie, shirt was in ill repair, they should be embarrassed that they even presented this product for someone to wear. i would have been better off purchasing a $100 polyester suit from jcpenney then renting a terrible tuxedo from this company. save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else. one star is generous."
865,"i bought an olympus stylus tg tracker at my home in milwaukee.  we traveled to the phoenix area for vacation and intended to use the camera on the trip. before leaving for phoenix, the camera's basic functions were working. upon arrival in phoenix the audio no longer worked on the camera.  i took the camera to tempe camera because they both sold and repaired olympus cameras.  i got passed from employee to employee before someone looked at the camera.  after he spent about 30 minutes with the camera he told me he had no idea what the problem could be and told me to call olympus tech support. how can an organization that sells and repairs this camera provide nothing more than a recommendation to call tech support. i am sure we will return to the phoenix area, but i have no use for tempe camera"
866,"wish i could give them a -0- / moved into our house 9/17 , roof had been completely done by let it rain roofing, 1/9/18 major leak causing major damage. took them 6hrs to come out and stop the leak. then told they will be out to complete repairs and inspect remainder of roof. i have called every week since, and continually told they will be out later in the week. today is 2/28/18. still no repairs or contact from them. it's obvious they did not do a good job initially, and no follow up with their warranty. i will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau and nevada contractor board"
867,"never pay any contractor work through these guys up front! they're 4 months into my bathroom renovations and the work isn't even half complete. also, remember do not use blue ocean contractors. these guys put down cracked granite counters, messed up the grout and are incredibly rude."
868,"teriyaki experience is the same across the board. but this place has less portions, looks old and feels old. in need of a major renovation.  i would rather go to other locations than this."
869,needs a total renovation. locker rooms are filthy. hot tubs. are out of order. half the televisions don't work.
870,update...still happy with the overall result however we were assured that the sand used in our artificial turf would not retain the smell of animal urine over time and if it did they would stand behind the repair.  they were wrong and have avoided our contact attempts since our initial complaint.  very frustrating as we had rubber pellets in our previous lawn with absolutely no smell for 11 years. poor customer follow up and will probably not use for our courtyard expansion project.
871,( closed indefinitely ) my xbox recently broke down on me yesterday and i decided to take to vegas game repair which is also called the guru crew. they seem to have a bunch of different yelp business listings but don't be fooled they are the same place. the place has been completely emptied. there sign in the windows says it will be closed indefinitely.  i'm glad they didn't get a chance to run off with my xbox system.
872,"i just bought a house which is in need of some minimal deck repair work. i scheduled an apt with shashta to get a quote. i thoroughly explained how the area in need of repair is very minimal (about 10 sqr ft). the receptionist was very accommodating, but once the rep came to my house he told me that shasta has a 200 sqr foot minimum. thanks for letting me know after i left work early. i called the manger, mike, who was very understanding at least. so if you need deck work, be sure its 200 sqr feet or more!"
873,"stay away from this place. their post on craigslist is a joke. they never showed up on the schedule date to do the work. i had to call them, they sent the wrong material i ordered a job that was supposed to be 2 days took over a week. they sent this guy who was terrible, first he didn't speak english so he had to communicate thru someone else, i couldn't wait for them to leave my house because he was so unprofessional. they didn't finish the job and cost me any additional repairs. i had to pay more than originally quoted because supposedly the office forgot or didn't tell them the scope of the work. even for free i wouldn't want them to do any work for me. stay away from this place its a rip off. after i told someone about whom i have he told me start praying and he was right."
874,"i won't go into all of the details - it was a bit of a bizzare first time visit. i like the owner and looking at pictures everyone seems very talented. my main complaint is that within 3 days of my full set they were lifting, splitting, and cracking everywhere. i spent $60 on a full set that lasted me about 2 days. not sure what happened there. ended up going somewhere else a week later to get them repaired."
875,"absolutely no integrity.  i would give zero stars if possible.  they convinced my mom, who is recently widowed, she needed $5,800 worth of work to repair a small leak.  in addition, the leak ended up not even being on my mom's property.  they started the work without knowing for certain that it was her house, and it ended up being the neighbor's home.  the plumber realized this, but still said the work was necessary. thankfully my nephew was able check out the issue and realize they were taking advantage of her before they got too far into the project.  steer clear!"
876,"told me my repair job was too small for him to bother with and i should call someone else. i'll give him two stars just because at least he didn't waste my time, but really, what kind of attitude is that for a business?"
877,"stay away!  price gougers!  don't get involved.  they charge excessive ""diagnostic"" charges and then don't credit the repair costs.  
prices are 30-50% higher than neighborhood competition.
pleasant and friendly enough, but a rip off place.

ps:  never saw so many better business complaints in any dealing!
i was foolish that i didn't go to the bbb website before using and recommending this outfit----don't let this happen to you!!"
878,"i guess this is neither good nor bad, but the gentleman i spoke with from this number linked on yelp was not even aware he was on yelp and stated that he did not repair refrigerators...?  he referred me to another person.  i'm not sure how up to date this is."
879,"i purchased furniture in december of 2014, delivered at the end of january.  i have had 4 quality issues with the furniture.  i called to see if an exchange was an option because of the repeated quality issues in such a short period of time.  i was told they have a 7 day return policy and that i could just have the repair department keep returning to fix my issues.   this is the only resolve i was given.   i asked if an exchange was possible and i was told no.    i posted on their fb wall and i was removed.   they blocked me from posting.    do not buy furniture from this company.    the quality of the furniture is not acceptable, having 4 issues in not even 2 months.   i was a fan until now.  they do not offer any options and do not stand behind their products.   i am still trying to get an exchange."
880,do not... i repeat do not rent through this company. they will not protect the renter and will allow the owner to place repair charges on your acct. we asked about the rental agreement and how the charges were even allowed to be placed on my acct in the first place and they said they can't control it and it's up to the owner?!! what? that's not what was discussed when signing the rental agreement. i now will be seeking legal counsel to deal with this shady company.
881,"i was told by someone in the french restaurant, that the cafe is closed for renovations....how come palms doesn't mention that or there isn't signs anywhere??"
882,place is disgusting. i was told that they were going through a renovation.  yet i see an inspector come behind the bar to check around.  i've seen this man before.. pest control.  seems like they have an infestation of some sort.  i decided to leave because it seemed unsanitary and i didn't want to get sick.. gross .
883,"home warranty company sent them to repair my opener. the tech came out and sprayed the track and adjusted a sensor. the door still takes longer to open, but since it opens i guess that's all that matters. glad they worked out for others, but not in my experience."
884,i would give them a 0.  they were 2 hours late to repair my business internet and still have not arrived
885,"these guys ripped me off. they sold
me a pump repair for a pump. i could have bought a used one in excellent condition for what they charged me. now i see they've closed forever. what a bunch of thieves. they seemed like they had a history behind them.  i fell for it again --- bad deal. if you guys are out there. help me and i'll take this off and make things right."
886,"i have worked with countless handy people and the handyman that the company sent was not handy.  he was slow, cranky, did not exude confidence and took more than twice as long as estimated (i knew the estimate was too short, but he is the expert right? wrong!), and cost 40% more.  in addition he broke a very expensive personal item with little remorse.  i could not wait until he finally left.  cross lv handyman off of your list of go to handy people."
887,"they are lier. after you pay,they will transfer you to the other and the other departments and no one will help you. in addition, they will limit your speed to force you pay for a higher speed level. and if you don't use their model they will tricky you to made you ask for repair and then collect repair fee! that's what they do as a scam!"
888,this was a disappointing experience. major sections are closed off for renovation or removed for the season. they should be charging discounted rates until the renovation is done.
889,can't give a good rating as we have a sofa that is 2 years old and can't be used due to  a new  a cushion topper and have been waiting since november of last year for repair work
890,"i'm not surprised that this place is closed. while they are always friendly at this location, they are only concerned with one thing - money. they will constantly bombard you with lists of repairs that you need or don't need. for example, they were able to fix a small coolant leak for me, but the issue was actually much larger. it's a coolant leak that requires labor for about $2000! they knew that the second time i came in, but managed to squeeze $250 out of me first because i trusted what they were telling me."
891,"they tried 3 times to get my wife's lenses right. i had to go to a different optometrist to get the prescription right ! then to top it off, they broke my wife's frames in half right at the bridge. it cost us $39 to repair them. it was after i told them we would never return. i think they did it in spite. just run from this place. don't ever consider kokopelli. they are a joke."
892,"run, run as fast as you can away from this business.  once you have had the work done and you paid, you will never be able to get repairs completed, ever!  these are the rudest, crudest, humans i have ever dealt with in a business setting.  common courtesy and manners elude them.  i have been put off for months trying to get a seam repair completed on a very costly countertop.  how are they still in business if they treat customers this way? if i could give a negative star, i would."
893,stay away. quoted me $950 for a repair. i got a second estimate and repair for $310. the tactics and the approach of this company is un ethical at best. this company preys on the uninformed and weak. avoid at all cost. i took the time out of my day to share this with you. now i am going to praise the ac company that did an excellent job from start to finish and saved me $640
894,"i have 2 cats.  i don't like these people.  every time i've been there, i feel they charge me too much.  i don't like the advice they give.  i hate how they send me a million reminder letters - what a waste of money for them to mail. i've switched to dave & rick's dog & cat repair on rural rd (rural & elliot), and i feel a whole lot better."
895,extremely difficult to communicate with this company. took days to respond and in some cases didn't respond at all. scheduled the repair and requested the name of the technician we should expect in multiple emails. no response. very poor customer follow up.
896,"good company with quick response time.  however, they are a handyman type company and not a professional company...no booties, no prep,no cleanup and certain jobs seem too complicated. . no pre-thought to put down plastic and then left me with the mess to clean up."
897,very poor quality work and poor attitude when work wasn't performed correctly. had to pay another contractor $500 to repair their work.
898,"i had been to the lamp place several times over the years & had repairs done and purchased shades as well as accessories. however, had an awful experience this past sat. - both sales people totally disrespectful (not a 'hello' - 'how can i help' - not even a smile') it seemed that it was an inconvenience that i had stepped in. beyond disappointed - so was the rest of the group i was with. embarrassed that i had recommended the lamp place so highly. they were beyond rude."
899,so many pieces of equipment are always broken or needing repair. i know gyms always go through wear and tear but they have 1 flat bench to work out on. 2 pieces of leg curl equipment is broken. multiple pieces of benches and seats are broken by the dumbell rack. not good for business when it feels like half the equipment is under repair...
900,"this place completely ruined a very expensive sweater. the fabric was totally thinned out and it's not repairable. they gave me no updates, then refused to take responsibility for the damage, then offered 10% on my next purchase -- the sweater is worth $800 so that doesn't even big to cover the damage. i strongly recommend against using this place."
901,"ice man has been here four times to work on one of our units. first time:  repaired leak in evaporative cooler. pumped 5 pounds @ $60 per. two days later, he said it was the wire connecting the thermostat to the unit. he spliced the old wire on the roof with new only capping it. same downstairs and replaced a circuit board. said the warranty company wouldn't authorize a new wire.  third time (9 days later) replaced over-heated fan motor. fourth time (4 days later), unit is visibly and audibly leaking from king valve.""  part unavailable and will take 3-5 days (standard language).  ""we'll have to add 12-14 lbs.""
i wish we would have read these posts first!  these guys are complete stooges."
902,"this business is incredibly unprofessional. if i hadn't already paid in full i would go somewhere else. due to a delivery truck issue, my furniture repairs continue to be postponed. seriously? all business comes to a halt for over a week? ever thought of renting a truck to keep customers happy? i was actually told today that i should think about finding someone with a truck. unbelievable."
903,"i hired water treatment technologies to repair a leaking water softener. the unit was diagnosed with a leaking bypass, and it was replaced at a charge of over $180. a few days later i returned to the home, opened the garage, and found a small puddle of water around the water softener. wtt returned, and after examining the unit said that the tank was cracked, and the whole unit must be replaced. i asked why the bypass was replaced if the tank was cracked, and the tech told me that someone must have moved the unit. i explained to him that the house was vacant, and there was nobody to move it. ghosts? probably not. i asked if the money charged could go toward a new unit, but i was told that they don't do installs or refunds. but they do preform ripoff""s. ok he didn't say that last part, i just assumed it."
904,"they take everything personally and will harass and intimidate you endlessly.  money hungry slum lords who refuse to make repairs, make ridiculous excuses, and fair warning... they will win in court, no matter how much evidence/proof you have.  -"
905,cancelled my appointment half way through the day. doesn't seem like they are very good at scheduling if they overbook this easily. went with them originally since they said they could be there next day for repair. complete waste of time
906,if i could give this place 0 stars i would. jennifer is the most absolute disrespectful manager i have ever came across in my life she is very rude and vindictive. she shares private information about other tenants with other tenants. yells at your children and calls them dumb what kind of an adult does that. she takes her sweet time to complete any repairs in your unit and they do a terrible job at it. if you are looking for a place to rent do yourself a favor and do not move here.
907,"brought in my amp to solve a crackling noise problem. 2 weeks later, still wasn't ready for pick-up. when i finally pick up the ""repaired amp"", it now had severe volume loss cuz the amp tech screwed something in the efx loop. when i picked it up for the 2nd time, the volume issue was fixed but the intermittent crackling noise was still therw. waste of $75"
908,"they're the worst managment company to ever exist. slum lords. scam. they are charging me with fees and lying about where they came from. i am having to sue them just like the rest of the people in this review section. never ever rent from golden west managment. i am disabled and have ptsd and they have made my life so difficult to the point of contemplating suicide. i am not kidding. i wake up wanting to die almost every day. they ignor repairs and charge the $60 repair fee for shit that isn't my fault. i live in a home that was clearly renovated by an un licensed diy person and hats why the fans fell out of my ceilings and the sliding glass door blinds ripped out of the wall because someone didn't use brick screws, they used dry wall screws. absolute disaster. zero stars!!!!!!!"
909,"when i called and made the appointment, their first question was do you have a home warrenty. i dont. the technician came and said the freon was not low, but i have a bad compressor that could not be fixed. he said the ac unit was a discontinued model that parts were very difficult to find and expensive and it used a type of freon that was no longer compliant. the low estimate to repair was $5500. its pretty obvious i know nothing about a/c. i thought to get a second opinion. the new company said i just needed the refrigerant topped off and screws replaced as there was a leak. the compressor is not broken and i already do have the new kind of refrigerant. they filled it up for $265 and we are up and running again."
910,"i have called lyons on three occasions in the last two weeks in order to get an estimate for a small repair what i was told would more than likely be covered as part of my ten year warranty. dallas was here on 11/7/18. still no estimate after being assured that it would be forthcoming within a day or two. when i called to complain that no one was following up, i was told that there was no way that the small patch would be covered under my ten year warranty from lyons' previous roofing job. i am not sure why i was led on by two people from lyons saying that there was a strong likelihood that the warranty would cover the small repair that was required. it is never a good customer experience to raise expectations only to shatter them. btw my warranty expired april 1, 2018, and i called in october to request an estimate for a raised bubble on my flat roof. i won't be calling lyons again."
911,"laron is a scam artist that fearmongers people into thinking that can't even drive home on a part that infact could be. told me about my part than got busted by his associate saying it was fine to drive on. they use fearmongers g tactics to sell 1000,s $ of unnecessary repairs which i would bet they don't even change the parts. he really unprofessional too! flaps his gums nonstop about himself while thinking you're on the hook for a $$$$$$$$ repair that doesn't even need. dont trust this place"
912,"i did enjoy living at boca raton for about 2 years. the third year they starting allowing anyone in. we started to have metro police coming to the condos more and more. there were fights and loud parties in the court yard areas. when i checked out after about 3 years, i knew i would have to pay more than my deposit to get the condo fixed up for the next renters. i never received a itemized list of what they repaired and a month later i got a letter from a collection agency for about 1300.00. i called boca raton about the bill and how come they refer it to a collection agency instead of sending me a itemized bill. all the manager said is that's the way we do it. i explained to her now i have a credit issue on my credit report and  she said i should have paid it faster. i asked for an itemized list of what they repaired and she said it was sent. i told her i never got it and could she send me another one and she said no. i asked for the company that runs the condos and she said she would not give it to me. i would not recommend  this place to anyone."
913,"recommended and installed goodmin air conditioner three years ago at a cost of almost $6,000.  july this year air goes out mid-summer.  costs repair - over $1,000.  now in december r months later heat goes out mid-winter.  estimated costs - over $1,300.  do not hire worlock they recommend and instal poor products.  buyer beware."
914,this place cannot be saved by the renovation. first off they make you pay as soon as you walk in. then if you ask for something like fresh rice because the old rice is hard. he literally just dumped the old rice on top of the new rice. this place is nasty.
915,"get an estimate. my bad, i did not for a simple shower repair because... it was so simple. turned into a $475+ job. on top of that the dude took a needed part and my shower now turns on when i run a bath. keep it, friendo,  enjoy it, i will never use anytime ever again."
916,his workers unloaded our furniture at a chandler cube smart. they worked hard but permanently  scuffed a leather recliner. justin stated several times he had a guy who would repair it....the repair man never showed and justin does not return our calls. i suggest you do not pay them or partial pay if you have a problem because the owners promise is not reliable...its been since sept 6th and nothing has been done.
917,"you have got to be kidding me. $1,000 to replace 4 shut off valves, $800 to replace a bathroom sink. what a ripoff.

a week later i hired a handyman. went to lowes and spent $40 on parts. it took him less than 20  minutes to replace all 4 shut off valves.

yes, sunny plumber was going to charge a senior citizen on a small pension $1,000 to do a job that was $40 in parts at retail and less than 20 minutes labor,"
918,"i called them for a repair on a system that they installed in my house when it was new.  they charged me $315, said my system was unfixable...they literally did nothing, but try to sell me a new system.  i called another local company; they had it fixed and blowing cold air within an hour of the technician arriving."
919,"i paid for grub treatment and our lawn has been devastated by grub damage. trugreen wants there last payment and sent me to collections, but refuses to repair lawn damage.  avoid."
920,i had an r/o system installed and it leaked damaging my cabinets. aqua science admitted they were at fault and said they would repair the damage 14 months later they have still not completed the fix of the damage done to my cabinets. left numerous messages and they failed to return calls and they missed several appointment when they said they were coming out. horrible company do not use
921,they still have not repaired the leak & damages. i follow up periodically reminding them it has not been fixed. sometimes they reply stating they'll look into it but nothing gets done.
922,hitting the bottom! this place needs renovation big time. chai was tooo sweet! i ordered a snack which didn't feel fresh- the next day i kinda exploded in the loo. the ambiance- can't describe it in words. i'll check it out again and see what happens with a bigger order?! good luck gi! at your own risk.
923,"i am only giving them one star because i can't give zero. we have relatives buried there and for over 20 years have seen how little they do. it took 2 years for my father-in-law's vase to be fixed despite numerous promises it would be done ""right away"". his veteran marker was broken (and stolen) and it took forever to replace. american flags are often run over by the grass cutters and nothing is done. it's sad to see how little respect is paid to people especially the vets. yesterday  on our visit we saw two wwii vet's markers run over. one was bent beyond repair and the other ripped out of the ground. it will be interesting to see when they are fixed. if there is no one around to report things nothing is done. if someone is around it takes six months to a year. very sad. once they get your money they forget who you are."
924,"they've had my lawn mower for over a month for a repair they said would take 10 days.  i called last weekend and they told me it would be ready this week.  i called today, a week later, and was told ""well, he's working on someone else's now, and yours is next, but it's 2:00 and we close at 3:00, so probably not until monday!""

if you need your mower repaired, take it to hastings hardware on babcock boulevard ... 1000 times better!!!"
925,update: just found out that ross replaced my roller brush under the vacuum with a substandard part - not a dyson part (which is what they removed). the roller they installed has thinner rows of shorter bristles. cheesy rip off. they should've at least retained my removed parts until i picked up the vacuum and was satisfied with the repair. clearly a business practice that benefits them at the expense of the customer.
926,"hands down, the most chaotic place i've ever been to!  i know they are doing renovations; but more signs showing the gates would be helpful!  we had a hard time knowing where to go and not much time to find it before my next flight.  it was my first time connecting there and i will try to make it my last."
927,"we are currently doing a major renovation in our home, my husband (he is a contractor) took me there to explore our options...from the moment we walked in until we left, walked around the showroom about 3 times, eye contacted with about 4-5 employees.. no one even bother to say hi or ask us if we needed help. wow...i guess our tank top/flip flop doesn't impress the staff there lol  , will never recommend our clients (i'm in real estate) to step in this place."
928,"apparently, they don't give written estimates, only verbal estimates. also, they left the a/c unit they inspected in worse condition that when they first arrived. based on our personal experience, we don't recommend this company for your air conditioner repair."
929,"worst place to go for repairs. some guy (i think the owner) by the name steve vany was so rude to me and pretty much told me i'm cheap. well, not everyone can afford what you're selling! but, everyone can leave a review of how you treat them!"
930,"*updating the review*

i called a local handyman to check out our garage door and all noise is now gone; it's like new. he also replaced the cheap rollers that were installed with higher quality pieces. 

dissapointed that i had to hire a handyman who was able to solve my initial issue. 

**response to the owner - my apologies, your guy told my wife it was $199 and i had not checked but just assumed it was correct. no need to follow up, my garage is now fixed."
931,"extreme cooling is a very dishonest reprehensible company! they send technicians out on maintenance calls and they blatantly lie about repairs you need. also, beware every time they come to do maintenance inevitably something will start malfunctioning either later that day or the next. stay far away from extreme cooling!!"
932,"ahs talks about protection, however it's always a fight to make them do the repair or replace the item.  you can eventually get them to do it but it always takes a fight.  yesterday my refrigerator was acting up.  they came out and said all was fine. today it's completely dead.  waiting for another visit."
933,"ridiculous!  the ad states a low call out fee, but that's to draw you in - then they have you!
the tech showed up...it's a $60 arrival fee which is waived for the $280 required to start working on the dishwasher - even without parts required!  i should have sent him away right then and there, but i wanted it fixed so i signed.  within 10 minutes he tells me it wasn't the dishwasher, but incorrect installation of the garburator was the issue.  so absolutely no repair or work required on the dishwasher.  guess what?  that's right - $280 plus tax all the same.  the right thing to do would be to charge me the $60 since no work needed to be done - but in and out in 20 minutes for $280.  
absolutely shameful!!"
934,do not ever rent from this company! they do not repair anything! multiple calls for gas leaks and broken down front doors to no avail! they loose all paperwork and when they do send out a handyman multiple trips to come fix stuff because they never seem to have the correct parts or the job wasn't done right the first time! and when it's time to do a walk through they look at u like a criminal and question every scuff and mark to get all of your deposit from u.
935,"well, even though everything seemed okay in november.  it seems that i was given a quick fix. no, they did not save me money on a hvac system.  in june, i had an inspector come out to check the house.  i was told that i did need new units, not one but three (3). so, even the one that they ""fixed"" was in disrepair.  when i contacted the company . . they said that they just fixed the heating problem in one room.. . . and they would give me a discount on 3 units. . .@7900 each . ha!!.  so, they got a little money from me in november.  but now, i am looking and found a ""really"" reputable hvac company."
936,"my finished product looked pretty good but a cabinet broke after a little less than two months and it took almost 2 months to repair... the staff is not very accommodating and they expect you to just accept your brand new, expensive kitchen being broken for almost two months... i did not want to write a bad review and i gave them several chances to rectify which is why i have to notify others... i want others to be aware that they do a good finished product but it is difficult getting there...

the install process was also frustrating due to contractors being late and the front desk getting things wrong. i did not feel like a valued customer."
937,"wish i found these before i bought this ripoff of a business. they charged $125 not to get the work done, but just to get the repairman out here for a diagnosis. it cost $1,100 to get it done. or $5,000 for a whole new system after the pennies this stupid company coughs up. and of course no refund of the $125 when i told them the work was too expensive and i can't afford it. now i'm out $125 for no reason."
938,don't waste your money on the new softener systems. works for a year. they have no repairmen to fix this system when it stops softening.
939,"called on 9/23/15 at 8:30 am to have someone come out and look at my roof for few minor repairs. talked to ashley and she was very friendly/professional (otherwise i'd have given 1*).

she said no one can come out the same day, but said someone will come out the next day (9/24/15). 

today is 9/27/15, still no show and no call??!!"
940,"owner called 2 hours before my scheduled appointment time to get an estimate to ask if i was going to hire them to do the work or just get an estimate. i informed him i would be getting an additional estimate and then decide who would do the roof repairs and he told me ""have a good day"" and hung up. don't waste your time with this company."
941,"dishwasher broke. called ahs for a repair. they charged me the $75.00 and sent a repairman out the next day. 
he said he didn't have the part to fix it and he left. 
i went online and found the part. i bought it. shipped to my house $30.00. 
i installed part. now dishwasher works no thanx to ahs and the worthless repairman."
942,"if u can don't rent from american homes 4 rent! they raise the rent every year between 50 to 80 dollars a month, and the maintenance department is awful they hire the cheapest people they can find and repair everything the least expensive way possible! i usally fix shit myself that is inexpensive instead of dealing with them! avoid them if u can."
943,"i had an underground  leak in a transition between copper and pvc near where the water line comes into the home.  i had dug out the leak area and cleaned all of  associated piping for repair. the technician came out to look at the problem and gave me a quote of $604. for an experienced tech this should have only taken 1 hour to fix and the hardware cost less than $20. i paid the $30 quote fee and sent him on his way. the technician was very courteous and i am sure very capable. but no trades company is worth $600 an hour. i ended up spending $14 for tools and parts and fixed it myself. 

unless you have money to throw away try a different company. buyer beware!!!!"
944,i haven't been to las vegas in years. i know they allow smoking in the casinos and what not the room we had smelled like an ashtray. it was horrible. i was coughing all the time while in the room. at one time it seemed like smoke was coming in through the ac vent. there was renovation taking place all over as well. not sure i can recommend this place.
945,my father in law wanted to get his roof repaired and contacted t& t roofing to do the job.  i can't believe how bad the repairs look. i am so disgusted with the work that they did.  i would definitely not recommend them.  i would not give any stars but i guess that's not an option.
946,"most expensive and cheapest couch ive ever bought.  we bought a new sectional with power recline and all the bells and whistle's for our new house, and within the first year the thing has broken 3 times.  thank god we bought the extended warranty.  regardless, we will never buy another item from levins ever!!!!  they refuse to replace the faulty section, and insist in sending a repair person out all three times, which takes about 6 weeks from time of call to when the couch is fixed, not to mention my wife or i had to take time off work to meet them.  worst experience ever.  don't make the same mistake we did.  avoid at all cost!!!!!"
947,"we bought a toll brothers home in sept 2014 when they were finishing up in verrado. the house had two hvac units with a baffle system that provided four zones. toll brothers sold it to us as a great thing but it has been anything but. the list of problems with the hvac system is long and the frustration with chas roberts is also long... repair people without a clue along with their belief that people with a brain can be pacified with lies. 

at one point they told us that you can't expect a system to cool on a 105 degree day... in arizona??

they also told us the zones only work if the temperature in all is set the same... ahhh then why zones. 

the system had installation problems and is still,  five years later,  not working right.

the reason i gave them such a high rating of one is there was no lower."
948,if i could rate negative stars i would. i've been emailing and calling for many months to get a dangerous broken balcony roof fixed. my tenant has also been a squeaky wheel. this company is the worst communicator in business i have ever dealt with. months later and still not repaired. i would highly advise not using them.
949,"my experience with burdette has been highly frustrating. the install about a year ago was very uneven and required mutliple revisits by installers to get things right. (doors and drawers that wouldn't close, panels installed upside down, damaged paint, etc.) since then, the cabinets have worn excessively, paint is chipping, door moldings have come away from the frames, hinges have loosened because of stripped screws. despite attempts over eight months to get repairs on the above items, nothing has happened. i cannot recommend burdette for work in anyone's home."
950,i had a lot of drywall repair work that needed to be done in the garage and living room. i will need to have someone else come to redo the work unfortunately and sad that i'll be paying double for this. the plumbing repair in the bathroom tub is satisfactory.  would not recommend for drywall.
951,"the absolute worst example of professionalism i have ever encountered.  made an appointment for fireplace repair a week out.   stayed home on the day of repair, and the scheduled time (1:00pm) came and passed.  called them and they literally were like ""oh..um...we overbooked, and uh, can we come at 3:30?""   4:00 pm rolled around.   i called again, they said someone called and cancelled the work order.  they couldn't even tell me who cancelled it.   do not use these incompetent people, especially if your fireplace uses natural gas, they are likely to blow up your home."
952,not happy with my experience.  gentleman did not explain well enough about repair and did not write anything down for me.
953,"this garage is less than friendly. they will do the work, but the repair costs are too high and employee attitudes are too low. don't waste your money. move onto a garage that stands up to its name."
954,"i took my daughter here for physical therapy and was extremely disappointed. the receptionist continually made unprofessional comments and made situations extremely uncomfortable. they therapists just want to get you to pay for a larger package, they do not want to see you recover. my daughter, who had acl, mcl, and meniscus repair was barely helped and had to continue physical therapy with a different office. i was also charged for copays that i paid, i should have kept the receipts, but they will do everything in their power to rip you off. would not recommend."
955,"brief update.. asked for a simple repair (well within their domain of repairs.. a minor electrical one).  i got attitude, i got hung up on, i got no repair.  i'll fix the damned thing myself and knock the cost of materials and my time off next months rent.  good thing i'm qualified to do electrical work.  this place is like a gulag without the charm and warmth."
956,"mccandless trucks are total crooks.  they replaced two fuel injectors with used and not even the right injectors.  truck ran like crap after they worked on it and then broke down.  the lying sorry bunch did'nt even put in rebuilt ones.  charged $2,700.00.  then the lying bunch could not find my truck for over three weeks when i called to see if it was ready all i got was bullshit and then jerry told me he could not find it and he said they would eat the cost of repair because of causing me to have to pay for all the extra rental time because of.  and by the way they made over $4,500 on a little body work the same time after jerry found my truck. cost me an extra $3,500.00 for a rental.  all these sorry bastards do is rip you off.  should be in jail."
957,"*update* surprise surprise my ac unit broke yet again. this will be the 4th time we've had chas roberts come out to ""repair"" it, 3rd time in less than a month. i'm so sick of this happening. nobody seems to know how to fix the real issue or even know what the real issue is. my concern is after my warranty is up on my home in a few months, this will continue to happen and i will end up paying thousands of dollars on repairs or replacements. this is a new house!"
958,"no mapping or measurements done, freehand microblading? had to pay to have repaired"
959,called and set up appointment for estimate on wednesday came out that afternoon and did walk through of issues to be repaired. never sent  the estimate after two calls on thursday and one on friday.don't seem interested in doing the job so i would never call again. i was told the estimate would be sent email but never received.
960,"very disappointed, new motor mounts installed 14 months ago, worn out already!! i asked for any resolution only to be told that 12 months is 12 months, on a repair that one should expect to last significantly longer."
961,"verbatim response i got while trying to repair a dining table
 ""it took a lot of work but, i was finally connected with someone at jofran inc. i explained your situation and was informed that even through the manufacturer, they only offer a one year warranty. i explained to them that all you need is the corner blocks at the bottom of the table. they explained that unfortunately there isn't anything they can do. the gentleman i spoke with suggested going to lowe's or home depot to have new ones made or to see if they have some available to purchase. i apologize i took some time to respond, like you said, it was quite a challenge to reach someone at the company. i hope this information is useful to you and you are able to fix your table.  """
962,do not trust this guy. three months ago i paid him 2200 to repair my roof and he didn't stand behind his work and wanted to charge me another 635 to fix it. he said the best thing to do was tear it off and replace it and i said that's what i asked you 3 months ago! if i should replace it and you said no it just needs repair. i told him he needed to fix it for free but didn't get a yes on that one. zero integrity and super high pricing.
963,"the place is very dark.  when sunlight comes through, it was very dusty. one of us used the pull out bed and the sheets had not been changed!  i knew, because when i pulled the bed out, all these crumbs from the previous quests were everywhere.  had the sheets been changed, there would not have been crumbs, it would be clean.  i now wonder if the main sheets were changed. the couch cushions were hanging out, very old, toxic memory foam, just gross.  they do not keep up this place. the jacuzzi didn't work. maintenance came and said, you have to switch the breaker on and off each time. no note on this, and the tube needed repairs. i think they either don't hire enough housekeepers or pay them low, no one checks their work.  the floors are so full of built up grime that my husbands feet were black within no time.  we left happy we are not owners."
964,"a dump. needs a complete makeover and staff training. staff was friendly, but not really very professional. the building is undergoing some renovation, but that just means that the crew needs to step up their game to match the circumstances. every interaction i had with the crew was a bit sloppy and haphazard, but very friendly. i think they just need a bit more pride in where they work."
965,"awful, i had a briggs and riley that they had to repair, and my luggage was awful.  i had it shipped to manufacturer itself"
966,we did not stay at circus circus but visited in the hopes of having a good time. well this place was sad and dirty and in total disrepair inside and out...if we had booked here we would not have stayed. i would rather sleep outside. there were hardly any employees around to answer our questions and the gambling was not good.
967,"it's not like it used to be 10 years ago when i first went to this place.
it needs some renovations asap!!"
968,"just a repair denial company for home warranty thief companies.  tell you it was wear and tear and covered to your face, then report something for a denial to the company.  absolute thieves.  them and the warranty companies they work for.  stay away."
969,"oh gawd! i made the most and worst common mistake when coming here...and that was coming on a saturday night. i took my 4 year old to meet up with some friends and their kids who were visiting from out of town.  i should've passed. geez, this place was super packed and is it just me or does the place smell like its in need of a renovation? it kind of reeks of old, layered cigarette smoke covered with nose burning odors, masked by cheap febreeze. i don't know it was just blah. the acts were ok and kept my little entertained and from wanting to spend more than my take home pay. games are pretty expensive and for a little one who likes to play and get one of those cute dolls, mines was really upset and sad. so i may pass on this place and just opt for chucky e. cheese since it's let crowded and she's more likely to enjoy her time there."
970,"just a repair denial company for home warranty thief companies.  tell you it was wear and tear and covered to your face, then report something for a denial to the company.  absolute thieves.  them and the warranty companies they work for.  stay away."
971,"a complete waste of money.  i've had an air conditioning unit that has been waiting for sears to get its bureaucratic butt in gear and have it repaired under their home warranty.  today is day 69 since our claim was filed.  after paying $1200 bucks in out of pocket fees to sears, our ac still does not work!  no wonder series is on the verge of going bankrupt.  good riddance!"
972,update:  the company has been in touch with me to resolve this situation and are scheduled to make the repairs while i'm at the house next saturday.  i will provide another update once those repairs have been completed
973,place sucks. they are really cheep when i comes to repairs. they try to half ass fix stuff until it's completely not repairable instead of just replacing it the first time. it's 110 degrees out side and this is the third time my a/c has went out in less then 24 hours. try to rent from someone else or the owner directly!!
974,tony knows how to fix things not broken and break others to get your money. charges for repair never made.
975,"don't use this company!!
i called this company for repair on a unit two years ago. they came out and did not want to deal with the problem because my refrigerator was too old. cha ching, $90 trip charge for nothing. called another repair company and they came out and fixed the problem.

today, called for a repair on another refrigerator from this company. they came out and said this unit was too old and they said other company's will come out and fix it and told me the part it needed. cha, ching $95 trip charge for nothing. 

they knew how old the units were before they came out from the model number. this is total fraud to know you are not going to work on my unit because of it's age before you come out, but come out anyway."
976,"this company was sent to repair our dishwasher by american home shield, our home warranty provider. we knew the old dishwasher needed to be replaced. fidelity sent out the same repairman 5 times and, despite minor adjustments, he was never able to fix the dishwasher long-term. we finally demanded that ahs send out a different company. it took that new company's repairman 2 minutes to discover that, yes, we indeed needed a new dishwasher -- something the fidelity repairman refused to acknowledge."
977,tried to call to ask about a repair and the mailbox is full and can not receive messages.
978,"after reading my complaints, the company contacted me and offered to pay for the repair.  my furniture is now acceptable.  i have updated my review from 1 to 2 stars."
979,"this company is horrible. every time you call to get an update on the repair status, you get a difference answer depending on who you talk to. i highly recommend taking names, every time you call. home warranty stuck us with this company."
980,"it is expensive and you get about 1/3 the internet speed you pay for. they give you some song and dance about how it's under repair for the next three hours or something like that, but let's be realistic. they know what they're doing. i wish there were more options."
981,"my water heater went out yesterday so i called the number on the unit to have it repaired. the plumber came out, took a look at my unit and decided (seeming as though he wasn't exactly sure what the problem was) that it needed to be replaced to the tune of, are you ready for this? $4000 fricking dollars. are you kidding me?? give me a break, i've since been looking into the cost to replace it online and the most expensive unit is $1800, so what, $2000 in labor? and i don't need the most expensive one dude. what a joke."
982,is every escalator being repaired? seems to me that there may be an issue with the system.  so many are closed for repair.
983,"technician had a speech prepared. bait and switch, trying to sell unneeded repairs. jerks."
984,"poor workmanship, didn't do repairs properly, cracks all over, would not recommend them."
985,"had a roof leak, decided to replace roof. owner said he would start next day. didn't start for 5 weeks. left a stack of shingles and debris in yard. jammed up a drain. knocked gutter off the hangar. after many calls, still din't clean up or fix damages, or finish a bathroom repair."
986,$2500 to repair a/c and it doesn't work at certain times. unacceptable in phoenix heat. i wasn't going to get a refund. they tried hard but couldn't get it right. too bad for me!
987,"agree with other reviewers, total total rip off, but you are stuck as they are authorized by sub zero for repairs.sub zero should do something about creating this monopoly or people will stop buying their products. i know i won't purchase another sub zero or wolf and have to deal with this company again."
988,"run, as fast as you can. i read the reviews and assumed under the new ownership it would be better, and conveniently located next to downtown gilbert. i have lived here since august and had 3 leaks in my kitchen ceiling (one of which when it was finally repaired i was welcomed home with a wonderful mess they left from the repair), a pipe burst underground in my living room (which they have so kindly left an open hole in my wall for the past 2 weeks), and now i have not had water all day due (10 am - 6pm and still going) to another pipe bursting. save yourself the headache, don't move here. it's cheap for a reason. oh, and their new ""remodel""... ha!"
989,"requested a quote for minor repairs and only quoted by the job
wanted $1k for minor repairs 
i can do it myself for this quote
you tube is only a click away"
990,not a good experience. i'm still waiting for them to stand behind their work on a repair job that was very poorly done. more information to follow...
991,doesn't honor his warranty...  i was with my friend when they said they would repair the problem and never did
992,courtesy gets an f rating from me. this company took advantage of my trust; it seems to me that the total charge of $535.95 for 4 drains is excessive and their  1/2 lb container of bio-cleaner at $48.50 is way too high.  it doesn't matter that they have an a+ rating with bbb.org or if their repair men are good. they cannot be trusted to give people a fair shake and that makes them a bad company and i will never call courtesy plumbing again.
993,terrible communication. he said he would look at our property and get us a quote to repair some damaged stucco. he never did.
994,"i'm an out of state investor, and was looking for a handyman that i can call whenever i need work done in any of my properties.  used yelp- request a quote.  this company replied very quickly, however i wasn't interested in their offer.  the owner replies ""good luck trying to scam people- get a real job"".

pretty offended for sure.  a lot of these reviews say the owners are positive, energetic people...my first and last interaction with them...not so good.

update on their reply:  i never once questioned your policies.  all i said was ""no thank you"".  then you replied assuming i was trying to scam you.  do your research before you throw out harsh words like that."
995,"was great before the renovation, now it's all hype and pure salt.  unfortunate."
996,"i just wanted to post an update..... they come out and ""fix"" the system, it goes down again. it takes 2+++ weeks to get repair out. it works a week, breaks down again! to this day, the system is not working and we still have to pay!"
997,"universal windows direct installed windows and siding on my home which looks great, however i have had more cracks and chips out of this siding than i had with the 30 year old siding that use to be on my home. i strongly feel that the quality of the siding is cheaply made.  when i called to get the chipped section repaired on the lifetime limited manufacturer,s warranty, i was told it will cost $125, so much for a warranty. i was told that my $125 will be replaced it the manufacturer found that the siding was defective, so this mean to me that i will have to pay for this cheap siding to be repaired because i'm sure i will probably not be reimbursed. i will definitely not recommend or be a returning customer because they will not stand by their warranty. maybe this is a small claims case, i will explore my options."
998,"wish i could review it. drove from tempe out here only to find that it is closed for repairs until july 29 2018!! 
will update when we can actually go in it."
999,after taking my ipad here to repair the shattered glass and being charged 90.00 to replace the shattered glass ....within 2 days it was not working again....they told me it was the mother board and there was nothing they could do....keep in mind it was working fine even after i dropped with the exception of the glass....wound up taking it to another repair place....not only did they fix it stating in writing it was a bad glass that this place sold me...they were able to repair the corners and earbud port...that these guys also said were unrepairable....
1000,continues to repair same area of the new roof they installed several years ago.  now throws warranty issues at me.  not willing to fix the problem or take responsibility.  very disappointing.
1001,"i called because one of our a/c units was not working and air dynamics was able to get a tech out within a few hours to assess our situation.  within minutes of arrival, it was determined that our compressor shorted and we were facing a very costly repair or replacement.  we were given estimates to repair, but both were for 3 ton units.  our system is a 5 ton.  hard to get a real comparison on costs when you tell people you need a new 3 ton unit and its actually 5 ton.  as well, there are more components that should have  been inspected to make an accurate determination.  i learned this through contacting other companies, who asked several questions that air dynamics did not.  and when we asked about other brands, than amana, we were unable to get bids for those products, as their system was not updated with that pricing.  based on this experience, i could not recommend this company."
1002,buyer beware!!! they don't stand behind anything they sell unless you buy their warranty.  new washer and dryer totalling over $1500.00. 3 month's old washer is totally dead. i called and spoke with the manager who told me because i didn't purchase their warranty i was out of luck i needed to call samsung. samsung is not much better. almost 2 weeks and supposed to come out tomorrow to repair. we will see. had to pay to go to a laundromat. will not buy from conns again! not worth the 90 days free interest!!
1003,"it's the perfect size and location for a billiard hall with great parking. unfortunately, after 15 minutes there...you feel like you smoked a pack a day for years and smell the same way. this place could sure use some renovations or new owners. perhaps some competition in the area."
1004,"after the renovation, i thought they would have made the subway platform wider for both directions but no. they didnt."
1005,"use to be good.  this time broke the mirror (i took pictures).  3 weeks still no word from them on repairs.  today went in with husband, and found pj, the owner, refuses to fix.  thank goodness i took pictures for proof.."
1006,"very courteous just as their name advertises.  however, beware of being nickel and dimed to the nth degree. $120 for 1/2 hp whirlaway garbage disposal (that is $60), 1 hour labor to install at $120/hour, $35 equipment charge (to pay for the tools he used).  where is a reasonable handyman in phoenix, az?"
1007,"i only go here when i absolutely have to. while it's a big loblaws, with handy access to the subway, the produce section is horrible. 

i went by last weekend to pick up some raspberries and they were swarming with fruit flies. yes, i understand that you can't help but have fruit flies around produce.. but this is a regular occurrence at this place. it was gross. 

i have also found pepperoni sticks a few weeks after the expiry date on the shelves. that was a year ago, so maybe things have changed, or it was just a fluke. 

it's undergoing some renovations - looks to me like it will look a bit like the maple leaf gardens loblaws downtown. hopefully their quality will also go up."
1008,horrible place to live!! the maintenance takes 2 weeks to come repair anything! the office lady is always threatening to evict you if you don't fill out low income paper work which doesn't apply to you!
1009,do not bother to contact them for quote we they came out to give a quote for the repair or replacement they did go out and the gave us a email quote without any details when asked to give us a formal quote they told us they would have to go out again to measure and it would cost $125 for that  most everyone else will give a free quote it seems like a bait and switch
1010,"this place is an absolute rip-off. i went in to have my necklace repaired and the lady talked me into purchasing a gold rope chain for a ridiculous $485. i was in vegas so i figured what the hell, so i bought it. when i returned home from vacation and weighed my necklace, the thing ended up weighing 4.2 grams!! i would not recommend this place. they are snakes!!!"
1011,"get a second opinion for selecting.

the gentlemen showed up promptly and were very pleasant.  however i was skeptical of their quote as there was very little damage from the leaking water heater -- and it was just slightly above what they guessed my deductible to be. so i requested 2 other companies to come out for a quote. both indicated that the damage had not traveled into the house and the only thing that needed to be replaced was a base board in the garage on the pedestal that the water heater sits on. 

drylux was nice enough to call shortly after their visit and offer me a discounted rate from the original quote but a discount on unneeded repairs isn't much of a discount."
1012,"went there 2011-04-17; the place is closed.  sign on door says ""closed for renovations"", but there there was no renovation visible and the ""noodle palace"" sign over the door has been removed."
1013,"warning...!!! 

scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......scam...... 
rip-off artist. had a friend, that is an a/c repair tech, look at my units and tell me my compressor was out on one, and added 2lbs. of freon to my other unit. i payed the $75 for their diagnosis to get them here, even though i knew what was wrong.  they quoted $4000 for the new compressor so i told him to leave, he said he added 7lbs. of freon to the other unit, without my say, and gave me a $495 bill. i said i was not going to pay it. he said they will send me to a collections company and mess with my credit... . so i payed..

warning...!!! 

scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......scam......"
1014,"the worst company that i have ever dealt with.  i paid them $263 for a water softener warranty.  their tech came out to look at my water softener, and he ordered a part needed to repair it.  the part was suppose to be sent to me, but it was sent to someone in another state!  i called sears numerous times, and they refused to resend the part."
1015,"do not use this company.  we called to have our a/c repaired and flores said they would have to replace the compressor, without looking at the a/c.  
called another company, they sent someone out with an hour and replaced a compressor motor condensor.  20 minutes and fixed. 

flores is looking to rip you off!!!"
1016,"bought a house & they came out to inspect septic, charged $200.  found a outlet baffle missing. said they would repair never did. $95 to inspect, $75 to find tank? fuel charge $10 and travel charge $20 (they are 20 minutes from our home).  payment was mixed in at closing otherwise i wouldn't have paid these..."
1017,"at first i was satisfied but after opening boxes, i found too many things broken including my daughter 's desk which they did tell me about. i had to wait 3 wks. 4 a repair person to come fix it & when talking to the office abt. asking for it to be sooner, their attitude was apathetic! and i regret tipping them- asked if they wanted a great futon- they said no, then futon was gone. no thks, etc. i was left w/ a negative impression!!!"
1018,"there is a contractor adage: ""good, cheap, fast, pick two"". brenner manages to do none of the above... i could tell you a very long story about my experience with them, but it would not fit in this review. it involves a water heater leak, bad repair work, a poorly re-installed water softener, another water leak, more bad repair work and a robbery. brenner's motto is probably ""eh, that's good enough""."
1019,"run the other way! if your home warranty assigns them, request a different contractor. pitiful operating procedures, horrendous communication. waste of everyone's time and will further complicate your repair with their ineptitude."
1020,"they said my whole unit needed to be repaired.  for about $8000. i declined. i went around the corner where another license contractor was working and he did the work for $200. in less than two hours. he was license, bonded and insured"
1021,"amateur exterior wall stucco repair. they couldn't come close to matching the finish and texture of the stucco. 
they came out the next day but it seemed like a rushed job. just disappointed."
1022,"jk gives it a 2star and hopes they improve it within the next few months.  in my opinion, most of the course should be under repair basically.  most of the tee boxes, greens and fairways are very rough with lots of bare or close to bare patches, or uneven surfaces, and the ground seems to be very hard in many places even where there is a thin layer of grass. it appears to need major work throughout.."
1023,"this place is a joke, they came out to look at our minor pipe repair and quoted us at $350 to fix 2 connector pieces. i told them we got a different quote for $210 and they laughed and charged us $30 to come give us a ridiculous quote. they are way too expensive as from their other yelp reviews looks like they don't even do quality work. i wish i would have looked on here before even having them come and look at our house."
1024,i can't wait until renovations are finished. who had thought a windowless maze of corridors randomly connecting train platforms and the ttc would work? more bathrooms and late hour trains would be much appreciated.
1025,"the worst place, rude employees, i come
over to repair just one finger, and they just say wait nothing else, how long or i don't know i am very disappointed"
1026,"oh, that was supposed to be a golf course? if you cannot afford to play golf.....go to great eagle. 2 million in renovations and a clubhouse / restaurant / facilities scrubbing might make it passable."
1027,"yeah... i beg you do not trust your trailer to these people.  they have had mine for 5 months and they literally can't keep track of their lies.  for the record i bought this trailer brand new from them and they now have had it ""in repair""for longer than i have had it available to use.

don't come here.  run away.  flee."
1028,"nice employees, but this company is not christian...they are out to make money at your expense. they are preying upon innocent homeowners who don't have plumbing or electrical expertise. i was quoted $3500 for an electrical fix. when i got a second opinion, another company quoted me $375 for the exact same work. plumbing wise, $1000 quote to repair 3 leaking faucets...a second bidder laughed and said, ""it would only cost that much if it was 24k gold!"" rip off. this company should be ashamed of themselves. 
instead, check out clear air & power & electrical or beebe's plumbing."
1029,if i could give them a zero star i absolutely would (and i would be way too kind even doing that) i have had a broken couch since february which is when i opened my work order to have my furniture repaired. today is may 17th and my couch is still broken (you do the math). they will not contact you to follow up on fixing your couch. i have called constantly and keep getting the run around. this place needs to be sued and/or go out of business.
1030,i retract my last positive review. i had a reciever repaired here.the equipment they installed failed 5 days after the product guarantee. they wouldl not even give me a break in the diagnostic fee of 20.00 to have it looked at again. they told me it would be about another 150.00 to fix it again.  i would stay far away from these guys.
1031,"we called them once to fix our heat, -$200. we called them, again, -$500. oh and that was without giving us an estimate. just making the repairs and sending us a bill. and the system was still broken. we finally called another company and the problem was fixed. hvac problems can be tough, but there isn't much reason to take a chance with this company. there are plenty of other hvac companies who are more competent and communicative."
1032,i was so excited to repair my credit. my husband and i signed up both of us for $129 a month! as agreed we moved forward. a month had passed and my account was charged $129 2x. i called to explain this is not what we agreed i know the call was recorded and this was something we asked several times. they said it was in our signed contract. i have looked it up and down and it is no we're to be found. this place is a bully and stole my money. i do not recommend.
1033,terrible work.  would not make job correct.  streaks throughout outside   had to hire another company to repair their work to outside.had to go fix for assistance to resolve inferior work. do not use!
1034,"avoid this company at all costs, lack of communication is the name of the game.

no water in your unit, no problem we won't tell you. 

complete repairs no problem we will charge you and not even inform you until we have a lawyer threaten legal action and add fees. 

avoid these guys if at all possible."
1035,i have no words to describe the attitude of the owner when they were contacted about repairs to the entrance into my attic after their ac tech damaged the framing around the opening. he basically accused me of lying to him about how his tech was the only one in the attic. the ac company who finally repaired my ac unit did the work on the outside air handler and did not go into the attic.  they have to repair it since i won't pay for damages done by them.  fidelity home warranty should remove this company from their vendor list.
1036,"the coffee and donuts are your normal dunkin' donuts good. 

if you need to go to the bathroom, you're going to be frustrated. 
1st, it's kept locked. 
2nd, the lock sticks and you gotta jiggle it. 
when you gotta piss....this is quite irritating. 

minor repairs go a long way guys, fix your stuff."
1037,"tried this today as the little city cafe is closed for repairs, never again. out of the beer i wanted, less than enthusiastic staff and my sandwich was drowned in mayo. i ordered the cucumber salad as my side and it was horrible. limp cucumbers drowned in some watery white ""sauce?"""
1038,"these guys are fraud and their units are rusted, salvaged from junk yard and trash cans and useless.
they will not stand behind their ""warranty"".

few refurbished (!) water heaters were purchased and installed. within a day, they started to leak from the rusted bottom plate, the controller did not work and no support what so ever. we had to pay another plumber to come and he could not fix the issues as they were not repairable due to total rust.
stay away from them if you value your money.
spend a bit more and buy new or find a better reputable company.
they are pathetic jokes."
1039,"worst people i have ever dealt with. need to continually get handyman to keep my bathroom shower stall functioning. horrible ugly tile work. shower head fell off when i first used it. was sick at the time and unable to fight them to do proper job or file complaint with the state. only people that i have ever posted a negative review.
i"
1040,"discussed the repair with the staff, and agreed to the terms for the repair. however the story changed when i went to pick it up. just not a professional facility when the communication breaks down. if you use this facility.... buyer beware and get everything in writing."
1041,"the plumbing for my outdoor faucet had been bent and was leaking inside my wall. i called vegas valley and they came in 2 days, much faster than other companies.

the worker who arrived made a hole in the stucco to access the leak and soldered the pipe shut. while the repair was done quickly and well, i was frustrated that in the middle of the repair i was told that i would need to spend another $75 to replace something that wasn't leaking (hose bibb)."
1042,"my husband and i purchased a second sofa at thomasville. it was delivered three months later. upon delivery, we noticed it ""wasn't right.""  the pieces didn't fit together properly and it was poorly made. not what you'd expect for a custom piece that took 3 months to make. 
we immediately contacted thomasville and were told to call the claims/repairs department, which we did same day . two weeks went by, no call. we called thomasville again and were told the same. yet again, we received no call. 
we decided to dispute the charge with american express. thomasville flat out lied to amex and told them we waited 15 days after delivery to call them. 

long story short... this company does not stand behind their product or their customers. shame on you, thomasville."
1043,"worst place to live at, they wake you up with repair noise loud as a modufuka and they wont even tell before hand to let you know. i wouldnt even put  a star if they had that option."
1044,"first time after renovation and two items we order for take out was below expectations. teriyaki burger was salty and too much teriyaki sauce, tinono pork belly was terrible because the pork was saggy and looks like it was a left over, so in other words next time i will stick to my loco moco"
1045,"do not recommend, the owner is a dishonest scammer ,the work was shoddy at best ,a lot of property damage that was not repaired , they stashed their debris in adjoining lots which they were paid to haul away , i had to pay another company to come behind them and try to fix their work which in the end will have to be completely removed and replaced ,"
1046,"a contractor not a handyman, can't help with hanging a 20-25 foot banner in my place. got out of that work he said"
1047,"incompetent! they have made countless trips to repair my freezer for months and it still is not repaired. everytime they claim they've finally figured it out and assure me that's the end of it. even after the owner became involved, they still failed to show up for a scheduled appointment. they didn't even call! they also repaired my dishwasher previously and now it has the exact same issue again. they all claim to be so experienced and knowledgeable, yet nothing is ever actually fixed. and everytime they come out, within one week there is always a new problem; never fails. it's happened too many times to be a coincidence. don't waste your time with this company."
1048,charged $215 to diagnose and repair my banging kitchen hot water pipes.  1 minute fix. the hot water valve under my sink wasn't open all the way.  a real professional would have been able to diagnose and fix the problem in 5 minutes instead of an hour.
1049,was unable to diagnose the issue with my fridge and gave me incorrect information. told me it was too expensive to diagnose and/or fix and i was better buying a new fridge. called another repair man who was able to fix it in about 20 mins. would definitely not recommend to anyone.
1050,"zero stars!
liars, liars, liars!!!  they came to look at my dryer. the technician told me it was the electrical portion causing my dyer to not dry fully and to not shut down appropriately when the cycle was done. technician told me that he would send this info to ahs warranty company and that it takes about 7 days to get the ok to repair it. after a few days i got notification from my warranty company that the case was closed because the technician stated ""nothing was found to be wrong with the dryer"". i have not been this angry in a very long time. i told the warranty company to never ever send this company to my house. never again."
1051,i wish i could leave negative stars.  they source the cheapest labor and the cheapest parts.  the worst warranty company...it's less expensive just to pay for the repairs.  don't buy into this crap.  it isn't worth it!!!
1052,what a rip off!! i was quoted for $685 on a timing belt and water pump replacement on my 03 honda civic lx... i only paid $430 in san jose in cali and they used all honda parts. never going to this place for any repair jobs
1053,"it took 3 appts. for this company to show up at my door.  very unreliable.  by third appt., they did not even let me know they were coming, just showed up at my door.  they wanted an astronomical amount for a new install, and $1,900 for just the repair.  i had another a.c. company come the following week.  they fixed my a.c. for just over $200 and it is running better than ever.  i would never recommend them to anyone."
1054,"very unhappy. i had a home inspection done 17 months ago. last week i noticed my foundation stem wall has 52 feet cracking due to rusted rebar(extremely common in az). i call foundation repair company who tells me""this has been going on for years and you can clearly see the 26 foot patch irregularities and paint over it"". we then discuss my home inspection. after talking with multiple experts in the field , the consensus is that the home inspector missed this very long/obvious patch. i call afj today and they say they ""are not responsible"". why get a home inspection if they miss major things like a crumbling foundation? i would not recommend this experience to any home buyer! ever!"
1055,"run...run from this countertop company. they are a nightmare to deal with and i have been living it. i hired them in august of 2017 for formica countertops in my standard subdivision kitchen. nothing extraordinary just an upgrade. first, it took them 7 weeks, i was originally promised 3 weeks but ""something, something, something"" happened in the warehouse. so, a little bait and switch but i figured i could get over it. then the install. they broke the countertops while installing them. they would not return to repair them, instead they sent me to collections for the balance that was owed. it took them over 8 months to repair my countertops. it is now april of 2018 and i'm finally getting a repair. do not do this to yourself, heed my warning run from mesa fully formed. go anywhere but here!"
1056,don't do business with these people they are greedy and don't stand behind their product. we bought a harness and one of the straps broke after only a hand full of training sessions. the guy we spoke to about it tried to come up with every reason possible of why it broke and how it was our fault. he wanted $20 to replace the strap. i refuse to pay $20 to repair a defective product they sold us. we have never had this problem with other brand harnesses. their products are clearly subpar which is why they don't guarantee them.

they are pathetic jokes."
1058,"hired this company because of great word of mouth from home depot consultant team. the came out and took all the measurements very professional. but install is where it all went wrong. the measurements were wrong and shutters didn't fit right. paint job was poor like they did t dry long enough. i've been waiting three months with emails, calls and still no repairs made. they won't return my calls or emails no matter who i speak with. do yourself a favor and hire another company as i figure out how to recoup my losses."
1059,"worst company ever!  we bought our home from richmond american and sierra air installed the a/c units.  we had issues last year, they said it was a loose bolt.  this year we had problems with same unit and they said it's not covered under warranty and it'll be $581 to repair.  i called another a/c company and they confirmed it's covered under warranty.  the technician was also extremely rude.  save your time and don't bother using this company.  this is how he left our unit when we didn't agree to have the unit repaired at their outrageous price.  the technician told us the $79.99 fee was just for him to smile at us."
1060,this place is horrible no just does it look like some type of shady hole in he wall. the quality of the stitching that was done to repair my louis vuitton wallet was shit she ruined the wallet and the material they used is cheap. beware!!
1061,"absolutely horrible.  they came to repair insulation in existing doors and a performed pathetic work.  it was worse than my do it yourself attempt with home depot parts.  i called for a follow-up due to the fact the work was so horrible, patrick shifted me to another person after promising to send someone out to perform follow-up work.  the second guy only tried to sale me additional work.  patrick is a piece of crap and liar.  horrible horrible work!   stay clear of this rip off company."
1062,"they stuck me with $10k+ in repairs required after poor quality roof tie-in.  take a look at my photos that show water leaking to brick across the roof of my archadeck patio. they made a hilarious attempt to cover it up by cutting a hole in my ceiling, admitting mistakes with roof install and then as soon as they said they would pay for roof fix but not repair to damages inside - and i told them i hold them accountable, they lawyered up and pretended they had no fault. contact me for context on my experience and how awful eric kent & archadeck treats customers that pay over $50k for a new patio and then $10k+ for repairs."
1063,i have a home warranty with totalprotect. my oven went out of action on 12/23. sears was assigned my claim for repair of 1/3/2018. sears sends confirmation for repair to be done on 1/16/2018???? this is ridiculous. this is the second time (different issue) sears has provided an unacceptable appointment time frame. use anybody but sears!!!!!!!
1064,"your electrician was the last person to work under the sink cabinet when he connected the electrical cord that preferred forget to connect when they installed the garbage disposal. the base of the cabinet was so flimsy, it was not glued and only held together with one staple. we paid a qualified contractor to make the proper repair and it is fixed now. the cabinet door that would not open completely had to be cut down because your unqualified cabinet installer failed to account for the size of the cabinet, after preferred changed cabinet companies without contacting us first. yes, bill b. whoever you are, we signed off on the project only to get preferred out of our lives forever."
1065,i called in to see if they repair my refrigerator . the receptionist was so rushed .. didn't hear a word i said ... just quoted what the charge is for coming to the home. she said it so fast i had to ask her to slow down ... rude first impression was bad!!! no thank you !!!
1066,don't rent from this company.  had so many problems with property and had leaks and flooding.  when i moved out they charged me for every little thing that they wanted to upgrade but wasn't broken.  they took my 2800 and gave me a list of all they wanted to repair. i had pictures of property they are racist to blacks. beware of this reality company. i even had proof of what condition i left the home and they insisted we broke it. i'm warning you... dont they need to close.  i also made so many complaints and no resolution.
1067,"if i can rate 0 i would because this is the most horrible, worst  company i ever dealt with they can't fix my problems like my wifi and they returned it to me all scratched up and they told me i tampered with the software they are horrible pick another repair center i think motorola partnered with devils  ps not one person answered my calls"
1068,"i was extremely happy to have gotten a cello, even if it had a small crack. the sales woman was almost laughing when she saw the brand and told me over and over how she hoped i didn't pay much for it. she told me how cheap it was and how everyone had to repair this kind. i told her it was ok because i was happy with it. so she proceeded to compare it to expensive brands and show me what else was wrong with mine. i am still happy to have it and will pick it up before any work is done on it. maybe i can't afford a $2000 cello, but i am very happy to have one at all. very rude woman."
1069,these folks are garbage. slum lords. will not repair anything. blame you for their failures. kick you out in order to raise the rent. steal your deposit and charge you even more! liars and scum bags.
1070,"update:  i did receive a call.  i was so disgusted with our treatment that i had him deal with my husband.  he told my husband to get estimates on repair.  after spending time getting estimates and more money on them, it was determined that repairs would be $1400.  they offered us $500 and i would have to retract my negative review!  beware!!!  i will never accept that small of a settlement and not save others the pain!!!!  donor use them ever!!!!!!!"
1071,scheduling repair on less than 30 day old new high end frig had been a horrible experience. takes much longer than they advertise. experience had been at least one week not the 24-48 hours.
1072,"a very bad experience. they came, gave me and estimate, which i agreed. the next day they tore up my ceramic floor, opened the wall and then returned 48 hours later with an estimate mutiplied by 12. the quality of the work--mediocre at best. i could have hired a handyman and i would have had better work for a lot less. they are very aggressive, and pushy, want you sign immediately. i would not recommend this contractor."
1073,"got scammed of $85 and if not from the other reviews here could  potentially  be more! the guy this company send told us after few minutes of walking around that there's a leak in freon which i suspect is not the problem. we didn't agree on the repair so the guy left. we decided to call a different company with the best reviews the next day, lo and behold the problem is just electrical and the line is completely toast! how could the first guy miss  the basics and already decided to go on a more expensive one? thanks to the honest reviews on yelp that help us saved money. here's the picture of the real problem in our a/c system-"
1074,"i wouldn't wish this company on my worst enemy.  repairman was so rude, condescending and insulting i told him to leave.  he threatened me on his way out.  there wasn't even a disagreement about any repairs.  stay away (unless you like that sort of thing)!"
1075,"gloria represented the seller in our rocky river purchase and clearly enabled the seller to misrepresent the property in the ""property disclosure form"". from active leaks to mold remediation, the house we purchased had it all.  admittedly, we went ahead with the purchase even after our home inspection turned up significant repair needs since we intended to immediately renovate the home. only after the renovation could we truly understand the magnitude of the misrepresentation of our property. gloria's direct statements to us at the time of viewing the property were patently false and, in retrospect, it's clear that the salemaker was more interested in the sales commission than in actively researching and accurately representing her client's property--buyers beware!"
1076,the worst company by far!! no wonder this company has  so many bad reviews.. i just had my home warranty send a technician from this company to check out what is wrong with my ac unit and the guy shows up late.. he did the diagnosis and found a few things that needed to be repaired. it's been 3 days and he still has not sent the report to my home warranty and i've had to deal with the 100 degree heat.. so irresponsible! i would not recommend this company even to my enemies!
1077,"don't bother contacting this company for just a repair, they have no time for you unless you plan to spend major cash.  i wasn't sure of what i needed (the reason for my call) but was informed that if i wasn't planning on a new roof i would need to wait until sometime in january.  there are plenty of companies out there who are more than happy to compete for my business.  thank you!"
1078,"i had need of a repair for a sliding door (arcadia). everlast gave me a quote and recommended a new handle, track and rollers. rollers would be a special order. quote was 365.00! i did not use them. instead i used valley wide who came out, did not need a new handle or track. just new rollers and some adjusting at less than half the quote from everlast. i would just say buyer be aware and do you research before you hire!"
1079,i am very disappointed. they dropped my hutch and did not offer to replace my piece. i have had the piece less than year. it is soft pine and damaged... no discount or replacement. sent someone out almost two weeks after the move to do repairs. i will never use this company again. you hire professionals for a reason.
1080,"always struggle to find this place to be useful and friendly? i had a bent aluminum rim which can't be repaired, they didn't even have an old steel rim for me to use if i were to order a new rim while i wait for it to ship. 
maybe others find them to be helpful it just never worked for me!"
1081,"terrible. i paid this company to replace my flat, patio roof.  it continues to slough off sand and has now developed low spots where water collects.  fred, who claims to be an expert, came out to look. first, he specifically ignored that i said not to get on the roof until i get there.  he was on the roof when i arrived.  then, fred advises that flat roofs are ""supposed to develop low spots"".....well, not if they are correctly installed.  
don't use these people. the 5 year warranty is worthless because matter what happens, they say it's fine. no repairs needed.

this problem is in addition to the fact that they replaced tan cement tiles with bright red...claiming that nobody manufactures tan tiles any more.  ridiculous."
1082,the repair techs came out to repair my dishwasher on two different occasions for the same existing problem. when it still wasn't working i scheduled a third appointment with them. the day came and i waited around for 4 hours with no show and no call. when i called they said that they did not know how to fix my problem and that i should get a second opinion. very unprofessional and did not get the job done. would not recommend!
1083,"i know they remodeled this casino but there's honestly not much other than the linq promenade. the high roller isn't that cool, but i guess if you want to do it you can. the view is cool for about 15 minutes and then the rest of the time you are just looking at the roof of buildings, which really isn't aesthetic.

rooms were renovated but obviously aged. i believe they are still working on renovations. until then, i will update my review once the renovations are done and hopefully i stay at the linq! i honestly can't say i will, though.

had a bad experience parking too. i was 1 minute late on the meter because the person in front of me was having difficulty getting out of the parking lot. i wasn't reimbursed for anything, which is frustrating because i made sure i left early to ensure that i would have free parking! oh, and this was after my check out so i wasn't able to get free parking!"
1084,don't buy anything here. their delivery is terrible and repair department is worse. their warrant my program is a joke.
1085,well it time again to clean up and repair the men's bathroom. i understand they get a lot of use but hard to understand how they stay in this condition?
1086,"moved from az to fl.  paid north american beltmann group 9000$ to pack and move our items.  contract states deliver between 7/1 and 7/5(with me choosing date).  north american delivered our items 17days late.  we did not get our household until the 18th of july!  my family was forced to live in a single bedroom we rented, my baby slept in a pack and play.  
north american also lost several items.  we received the ps3 box, but when you opened the box, the console was missing.  they lost a comforter, art, a doll, ribbons and awards.  not to mention the broken items. we purchased mvp protection which states it will repair/replace/reimburse damaged and missing items.  
north american has not reimbursed us for anything.  i just received a letter today stating they will no reimburse us our missing items. they will not honor their own contract."
1087,one star is too many.  they lost 2 clothing items and once found (one month later) they were damaged beyond repair.  no compensation offered.  won judgment in civil court.  do yourself a favor and take your clothing to 7th ave and missouri.
1088,do not use they lie about repairs break promises. they make there renters responsible for home repairs! stay away!!!!!!!!
1089,"i hired guy mizrahi to do a lot of work on a vegas rental property. 
several things were left undone, he failed to return items taken for repair, and he makes promises he won't keep. the most important thing to me at this time is he refuses to provide me a receipt for work done and materials purchased. i have sent numerous texts and he will not respond. we are talking about over $3500 paid. beware of this guy."
1090,"- takes forever for someone to help you
- the "" one year warranty"" is complete bs. if you need to repair anything on your frames be prepared to pay extra (in my case"
1091,worst experience ever. brought my snowblower there for repair. repair could possibly be covered under warranty. talked down to me because i am a woman. tried to say it probably wasn't covered under warranty anyway. the tall guy named shawn that runs the place started hitting on me and when i showed no interest he just dismissed me and treated me with disrespect. the only reason i rated them a 2 instead of a 1 is because they actually fixed the snowblower. maybe hat was just dumb luck. i won't ever go there again. not a female friendly place.
1092,"i walked in to just get a repair on email and the gentleman at the front desk told me the lady who does walk-ins was not available and that i could call her to see if she could help me. i guess i should've called ahead? oh well i will be going somewhere else, was really hoping after reading all the reviews that this would be my new place."
1093,"i've experienced better from them indeed. when i first moved to pittsburgh in may 2009, i used to come here often. the wings were huge and juicy. then the place caught fire. after the renovation, their wings shrank in size. instead of big juicy wings, now you get tiny overfried wings. some of the wings are literally half the size it used to be. price of course remains the same. too bad though they used to have the best wings in pittsburgh.

as for cleanliness, not too concerned about it. why? everything is fried on the spot only when you order so it kills all germs! hah!. minimal handling as it goes into styrofoam box once out of the fryer.

by the way, its cash only."
1094,ac cranked up and won't turn off. thermostat won't work. waiting on the middle of the night and no repair. so many vegas options to choose from. this place is barely a step up from a budget motel. read the reviews peeps. run don't walk.
1095,"no way, no how!!! stay away, buyer beware. had 4 of these installed and i just love the extra light, but in time they will leak. i repeat, they will leak!!! all 4 of mine have leaked. that is not a big problem as the owner will come out and repair the leak. 

except....if 5-years have passed! then you pay a $150 to have new sealant. and you will pay this over and over again for the life of your leaking sun tube. these leak....period. 

you will pay! 

go somewhere else where they can guarantee their work, or at least offer a better warranty!

my two-cents!"
1096,had them put to my house to do a couple of small jobs and main water line repair. they replaced a bad cable in my bathroom tub. less than a year later it's leakier than it was before and they won't stand behind their work. don't use this company.
1097,"from friday to tuesday my family was without ac. the company came out on monday, but did not have,tge right part for repair. it was fixed on tuesday. 

the property manager who never responded to my emails."
1098,"ongoing repairs since june and it is now december. they are so quick to close repair orders that they don't bother to check if they are done. still have work to be done. their last repair idiot came out and fixed a hole to the exterior with elmers wood glue, because that isn't going to leak. negative stars."
1099,"bewqre do not rent from this company. homes are not move in ready. we have spent 6 months of repair, repair, repair. now we have no heat!  second week of no heat!!!!"
1100,i have had them come out to deal w refrigerator problems it appears that is their forte.  i have a fischer paykel draw dishwasher and had them come out yes he was prompt and cked out the unit and cleaned it no charge.  he returned again to diagnose that i needed a new motor.  i am still waiting for the repair this is prob 2 months waiting.  what is disappointing that there was no follow up call on what the problem was that my one drawer is still not fixed.  consumers be aware it seems refrigerators are their specialty if have any of the off brand be aware.
1101,"ken showed up to my house to give an estimate on a repaired door and to change an electronic ballast. he proceeded to make my door worse while examining it, and told me to change the bulb in my kitchen as if i hadn't thought of that or done that before. never even received an estimate."
1102,"our hoa purchased a warranty for the roofs after seamless said they would probably be good for another 7 years. 2 years into the warranty we started having a lot of leaks, and we called them out to repair/patch the leaks, months later the same units had leaks in the same areas. drywall was repaired at the homeowners cost, and the roofs started leaking again. after complaining to them they told me that the roof was at a catastrophic failure point for the underlayment and even if they patched in one area it would leak right next to the patch. clearly they over estimated the amount of life the roof had when they issued the now worthless warranty. we had multiple other roofers out to inspect and they said it would be unethical to patch an underlayment  in the condition ours is in because it will continue to leak and needs to be replaced. we have also been charged thousands more than we were quoted because of inspections they claimed ""weren't caused by roof leaks""

we also had them perform an annual roof inspection as our cc&r's require us to do, and they did one so they say, sent us a bill, but never received a report on the condition of the roofs or suggestions on things to fix, we requested one multiple times months and months ago, but never received one.

honestly if they can't be trusted to patch a roof correctly so it won't leak, i wouldn't trust them to do anything else. 

we certainly won't be using them again."
1103,"this place has seen better days.  the building is old and in need of a serious renovation or even better, to be imploded and start from scratch.  the smoke here is dense and the ventilation is subpar compared to the newer joints in vegas.

the funny thing is that it's always packed.  probably because it's center strip and rooms go for $25-$35 often.  in my opinion, i'd rather pay the extra $20-$30 and stay at the flamingo, which is next door.  low limit tables are also the name of the game here....so the low end gamblers have a home too.

overall, i would never spend my money to stay here or recommend it for my friends.

return factor - 10%"
1104,"referred to by home warranty company. started off okay with a timely and pleasant response. ended up being a nightmare with the company claiming ""no access"" to the heater unit in my attic. they wanted me to have a contractor come out and put in an access through the ceiling, roof, or wall and tip the unit on its side for access. after lots of research i had another company come out, look at the heater, it was as simple as a blown fuse and cap replacement. only a $255 repair and no access problems. i don't know why a&r couldn't do the same. i would have spent thousands on creating an access not to mention the construction headache. the home warranty company reimbursed me for the repair even though they originally said they wouldn't let me use anyone besides a&r."
1105,avoid this cleaner at all costs. i took 4 suits to them to be dry cleaned and they destroyed a pair of my pants. i spoke to one person named kieran who told me she could repair my pants and refund me. when i arrived the woman who greeted me did not honor the previously promised offer. stay away if you want to save your money and clothes. as i type this i'm driving home to review my other suits and make sure they didn't destroy more of my expensive suits.
1106,they sold very few of the pieces we brought in.  they also broke one of the pieces (it could not be repaired) and won't take any responsibility.  you'd be better off with a garage sale.
1107,slide has been broken and gated off over a year! lighting is extremely minimal at night and makes for an ominous feeling as soon as it gets dark which is 5:00pm this time of year. i wish the city would step up and do the proper repairs and put in some better lighting.
1108,"these guys no show! called and schedule a date and time to get repairs done. the day of the job no one shows up and no one calls. not even a response to my text asking if they are coming. unprofessional and a waste of my time. don't risk this happening to you, look somewhere else."
1109,"this used to be one of my favorite places, but it really seems to have gone downhill.  everything used to be spotless and the facility was always well lit, cool, and airy.   today it feels dirty and gloomy.   bulbs are burnt out, lots of things are in need of minor repair, stock is low, it's warm.   it feels neglected.   so sad.   :-("
1110,"the owner came to our house to evaluate our dog. i paid him $85 for his time and all he did was tell me the dog was beyond repair and should be destroyed and show me his bite marks all over his arms. i then reached out for a 2nd opinion and was told that he is not a certified behaviorist. what a waste of my time and money. oh, and the dog is doing great, btw."
1111,worst place ever!!!! they don't fix repairs in a timely fashion. i've been listening to someone's smoke detector alarming for over two weeks now.
1112,"i wish i had read these reviews prior to signing...each experience below i have experienced to some degree.  the maintenance team..meaning the admins are rude the majority of the time.  they want you to do all of the 'research' as they call it, give you the run around, and ultimately you end having to contact any contractors they or the owner have hired to prove you weren't the cause of a regular maintenance repair.  really rude, not helpful, and honestly i cannot believe i have rented a home through them.  i'm pretty concerned that one i move out i will end up in small claims court for some other bogus claims/fees they drum up.  i own a property and would never use them as my property manager because of teh horrible way they treat tenants."
1113,avoid this cleaner at all costs. i took 4 suits to them to be dry cleaned and they destroyed a pair of my pants. i spoke to one person named kieran who told me she could repair my pants and refund me. when i arrived the woman who greeted me did not honor the previously promised offer. stay away if you want to save your money and clothes. as i type this i'm driving home to review my other suits and make sure they didn't destroy more of my expensive suits.
1114,"no way, no how!!! stay away, buyer beware. had 4 of these installed and i just love the extra light, but in time they will leak. i repeat, they will leak!!! all 4 of mine have leaked. that is not a big problem as the owner will come out and repair the leak.  

except....if 5-years have passed! then you pay a $150 to have new sealant. and you will pay this over and over again for the life of your leaking sun tube. these leak....period. 

you will pay! 

go somewhere else where they can guarantee their work, or at least offer a better warranty!

my two-cents!"
1115,"set up renting house through keller williams.  found out when time to have a repair that the bourquin group handles the rental property.  my experience as well as many others are documented under the yelp of bourquin.
you should know going in what kind of treatment you will be in for.
very sad, just a little attention to doing their job and this could have been a good review. i guess, buyer (renter) beware."
1116,"never showed for appointments on two occasions, which did not give me a good first impression. i decided to go with someone else for my home repair needs."
1117,"the positive things about this place would definitely be the beds they were very comfortable. but they put throw pillows on the perfectly clean bed which is really nasty they look like they have never been cleaned and the first thing i do is knock them on the floor like everybody else.
the negative would be about everything else; we had a room with two double beds and the room was just to small for two beds, my husband and i kept hitting our shins on the corner of the beds. the bathrooms were in pretty bad shape. i say bathrooms because we had plumbing issues and had to move rooms, so both bathrooms were old and in need of repair."
1118,"great facility, staff and equipment but this company must be the worst in the industry at fixing things.   almost always broken equipment somewhere because it takes them 2 weeks to repair a cable or fix a padded seat.  how is it even possible for a company so big to be that slow?"
1119,"i went on home advisor website to get recommendation for a electrician they recommended fowler electric ltd in las vegas, nv this is not a company i would recommend. i made a appointment for june 28th and at the time i made the appointment the person i was talking to asked me if i want the work done at the time of the visit if i accepted the estimate and i said yes defiantly i need it done wright away. i told her that the last company that gave me a estimate was to do the repair when they came out. but they did not, i was told the work was not scheduled only the estimate. so fowler electric did the same thing the tech told me he was to only give a estimate."
1120,"i haven't talked to such an unhelpful, rude and unprofessional person as i did today. wow! 
when i called in to ask if they could do repairs i was insulted instead and he refused to even answer that simple question."
1121,my husband brought sons truck in for repair. knew what the problem was so left truck. call comes saying repair is almost 700 bucks! told son he said no! get parts so we did totaling under 50 bucks. the guy there told him to call and tell him how long repair takes said it was all labor cost cuz so difficult..really took he and his buddy under 1 hour! wow! so upset according to my calculations they were charging about 5 hrs labor. eighty bucks per hr were quoted. now does this seem right no!
1122,serious communication issues. had to chase down my property rep whenever i needed info about my property. billie me for repairs b/c they forgot to add my home warranty and i had to escalate the issue to a vp before the problem was fixed.
1123,needed a new diaphragm for a t3 zodiac. saw them all over the internet for less than $20. leslie's has free labor if you buy repair parts. easy fix. they charged $50 for the part. avoid leslie's like the plague. 500% profit margin is a bit high in my book.
1124,i made an appointment for thad to come out and take a look at our deck and quote us on the repairs. sadly he never showed.
1125,"i paid mark extra money  to match up maintenance to my 10 parts guarantee.  so, 10 years maintenance and 10 years parts.  i thought i was all set.  

 mark installed my a.c. unit three years ago.  i just found out that ....one....i cant find mark anywhere, two...my new unit was put on my old stand and it separated where the vent goes into the unit itself so i was pulling in a lot of hot air.  i did the math and i paid a little over $600.00 more last year  for electricity.  the whole a.c. unit was sort of leaning to the right.  i had to get another company in to rent a crane, built a new stand and make everything fit properly.  i checked my receipt from mark and it says i paid for a new stand. i hope everything is new on my ""new"" goodman unit. 

end result, i paid for a repair that should not have been needed.  i paid for 10 years maintenance from mark.  he is now no where to be seen or heard of.  there is nothing i can do because as it turns out, he is not licensed anyway.  this is terrible.  do your homework. what i mean by that is, make sure they are licensed (dont just take his word for it)  and not just have good reviews.  make sure they have been in business for a wile and make sure you have good communications with them."
1126,horrible. horrible. horrible.  we bought the home repair warrantee and they work harder at trying to not fix something than if i was just to have paid to have it done. total scam. google sears home warrantee and look at all the 1 star reviews. i wish i had prior to buying it. what a joke sears has become.
1127,i used to come here all the time and have a great time.. but my last resent visit was literally my last! needs renovation and new staff ¯
1128,"drove 20 miles across town because i needed a pull cord for my vertical blinds. they told me  sorry, we have it but we won't sell it to you because we don't make any money on it. what a complete bunch of hooey.  i wouldn't have them repair my blinds if they were the last place on earth."
1129,this place is always busy!!! hire more help! i wait over a half an hour to just drop off for repair or pick up.
1130,"they charged my neighbor $8400.00 for $450 worth of work.  i have heard since then that they charge $8400.00 for alot of their jobs that are minor repairs.  they must like that number.  i strongly suggest you get another estimate before you ever sign with them. they are high pressure, take advantage of older folks like my neighbor and have many legal cases against them, just search web.  they now have son on commercial instead of dad with that silly parrot."
1131,"what a joke!!!!! these 2 nitwits ""repaired"" my exhaust & 3 months later the tail pipe fell off. when i asked them 2 fix it they told me ""there is mud on it & that's why is broke"". hello this is arizona pal dirt & heat is what makes us!!!!"
1132,rip off like so many others say! this is truly one of the worst repair companies out there. take heed! they are more than twice the rate of other companies and they are condescending. if the extensive list of bad reviews isn't enough to dissuade you than good luck to you!
1133,"okay place to rest and shower.  aside from that, i wouldn't recommend it.  they are doing renovations and it is at a great location, directly accross from caesars palace.  harrah's should probably sell this property or do a property exchange."
1134,"pro: inexpensive
not crowded
con: staff turnover is insane
equipment needs to be repaired and more added
i am a member that signed at the beginning, they keep changing the rules for what is included with my membership. 
no longer can use xgt equipment when there aren't classes-which i was told i can use when i signed

can't wait for the new gym to open near me to get out of there!"
1135,"i can't believe the work they do, almost all the floor tiles are crooked,  they did not clean the mortar between tiles before grouting so now it has white spots coming thru grout   this was the 3rd time for a warranty repair, impossible to get a hold of sandy no matter how many messages or emails."
1136,i would. like to believe that your company is good and honest because of the customer's positive reviews.  as i mentioned on my first review your repairman told me that there was no way to repair it but to replace it. it was good that i looked for the second opinion.
1137,"took my vacuum in the be repaired, the quote was for 80.00 plus labor, when i picked the vacuum up, my bill was $170.00. there was no apology, only a ""i wasn't here when the unit was repaired"" beware when getting repairs done!"
1138,"they were quick, courteous, and informative. however, they charged me $80 for the free estimate, because he had to get his ladder and tools to diagnose the problem. also the estimate was $921 for a repair that another company did for $360"
1139,worst place ever!!!! they don't fix repairs in a timely fashion. i've been listening to someone's smoke detector alarming for over two weeks now.
1140,"do not use!!!!
they caused damage to all four sides of my suv and after months of jumping through hoops, they are only willing to pay a fraction of the repair costs. terrible experience, stay away!"
1141,"this location is closed for renovations! the website doesn't mention anything about it....same thing happened with the richmond hill location last year, they closed down for good with no mention anywhere. however, the richmond hill location still shows on the website.


i love wow wings, and travel far just to have them. this is not right!!!!"
1142,"i authorized work on tuesday, they estimated it would be finished ""early next week.""  i called monday they said tuesday.  i called tuesday they said wednesday.  i called thursday and they said maybe later.  if they finish thursday i won't be able to get it till friday!  (what, the customer has a schedule too?)  why is the repair business so often a license to steal your time?"
1143,"i closed on a house in dec 2015. for all the required repairs on the property, i asked for a copy of the receipts.  six months later, i had a problem with a repair performed by cornerstone mx so i called and asked if they stood by their repairs. he asked me what the repair was and without missing a beat, defaulted to it must not have been his work. i knew it was (it is on the receipt and all the plumbing work has the same insulation around it) and i stated it was and had a copy of the receipt. he said he wasn't available until monday (memorial day) to come out. i asked him if he was sure he wanted to schedule on a federal holiday. he said yes so i said ok. i waited for him and despite being an active duty military person, attended no events on memorial day because of my appointment with him. he did not show up and didn't return my call to him that same day. if he is also the same contractor that did some of the renovations in the house (and i'm pretty sure he is), i have some additional work i would have asked for a bid on e.g. bathroom remodel because the house has zero bathtubs.  he won't be getting my business.  what a flake."
1144,"they did great drywall repair/work, but left a huge mess for me to clean up. also paint work they did wasn't great. scott is very hard to track down and had to repeatedly call, text, and email to get receipts and info. won't be using them again."
1145,"went here with the family so that my kids could get their first experience bowling. did hear that it was recently renovated but honestly speaking the renovation was very superficial/cosmetic only. the floors still looked in pretty poor condition and almost all the bowling balls i used were dirty/greasy (my guess is people were eating and used the bowling balls). the should which we were provided looked like they were in fairly poor condition as well. the lane controls were ancient by any standards, and even the bumper (which i thought were supposed to be controlled via the panels on each lane) needed to be manually pulled open...overall, i likely probably will not be returning and will go somewhere else for bowling experiences."
1146,it's been a while but here's an update. i had my ductwork sealed and tested by nv energy a couple of years ago and they repaired multiple holes. air conditioning been great ever since.
1147,"i would not recommend this company at all. biggest waste of $75 ever. my home warranty sent this company out to do repairs on my a/c. the technician came out and talked for 25 minutes,collected the money and left."
1148,disappointed again with the poorly handled renovations causing a delay in reopening!
1149,"bought $10 grand worth of new windows from andersen about 10 years ago because i thought they were known for quality.  they are total junk.  they have a plastic locking system that won't let you lock the windows,  the plastic latch has literally popped off a couple of the windows in a pieces.  one window won't stay up and keeps sliding down to a closed position and when my wife called to complain they told her there was nothing they could do.  i've had their repair workers out at least 8 times to show me how to lock them,  when i try to lock them they won't lock.  infuriating!!! don't waste your money on this junk."
1150,do not use them ever. very money hungry. they charge $99 just to visit. then the repair bill is outrageous. i had a furnace drum wheel (fan) broken. cost of part $47.50. i estimate it will take a person 1-2hrs to fix it. j&a estimated bill was $451.00! they are charging $250/hr labor. that's more than a rocket scientist makes.
1151,"awful looking futon frame. i called the company and they were rude. i had wanted to know if they knew anyone who could put it together for me. 
when i said it would take a couple of hours to put together, which handymen have all said was true, she replied ""that's not true. a ten year old could do it.""
i asked how i could return it. she told me ""we don't deal with that.""
don't buy this futon frame. you will have to deal with the condescending people at this company should you happen to need assistance."
1152,"this isn't a true review, as i have not seen the show in the last four times i went to vegas. i'll forgive them on the basis that the last time we went, large banners announced its renovation till november 2008 or something like that. so bf and i walk in the cold all the way to the mirage, and something looks a little strange- like there are no people waiting for the show, and the water is very low...and look! a tiny sign saying that the volcano is temporarily not showing or something dumb like that. we are annoyed, and have decided to boycott the stupid show from now on. we are going to march right past it next time, even if it is going off."
1153,"this plumbing company was sent out by my home warranty company. first, i want to be fair in stating that, this review is not about what was authorized or declined by the warranty company. many of the negative reviews posted here are based on the fact that the claims by the warranty company were declined; after all, the contractor does not have any control over what is covered and what is not. therefore, the reviews should not be about the denials of the claims.

this review is based on what the technician did as well as what he failed to do. the issue at hand was leaking faucets. upon arriving, getting approved, and replacement of the parts in question, the faucets continued to leak. the technician then told m that, the faucets themselves had to be replaced. he issued an estimate for builder-grade faucets and then made the sales pitch that, to upgrade and get the like-kind faucets, they will be extra. the total estimate came to $1,300.00+ for the like-kind replacement faucets. the fact of the matter however, is that my warranty had the coverage of like-kind replacement. 

i was not about to commit to anything so, i told him that, i would think about it. i then called another plumber i know, had him come out to assess the issue. it turns out that, the technician from am-pm plumbing installed the inserts improperly, thereby causing them not to seat properly. this in turn caused the leak after the repair was done. the net amount i ended up spending? less than $160.00!

whether the inserts were installed improperly on purpose or not i cannot assert. but the fact remains, that, a consumer was about to spend exorbitant amount of money on fixtures that did not need replacement. in either case, whether the act was that of predatory or incompetence, the net results were unsatisfactory to say the least, and gauging an unsuspecting consumer at the most. 

i will never use this company again, and if i have a plumbing issue, and have to call my warranty company, i will ask for someone other than this plumbing company."
1154,"the worst thing about my night here was the loud noise from the highway when i first tried to go to sleep.  fortunately, traffic died down enough after midnight that i was able to sleep at least a little bit.  other negatives:

1. the tiny shard of glass that embedded itself in my foot when i walked in the bathroom in bare feet.

2. the relatively long wait for checkin at 8:30pm on a weekday evening.  there were about six people ahead of me and (at first) only one person at the check-in counter.

i agree that the place is in serious need of renovation and updating.  that was true, at least, for my room.  i have seen better, but maybe there's nothing better this close to ctl."
1155,horrible. they came to fix a clicking noise in the refrigerator and left with the compressor non-functional. the refrigerator was no longer cold and i couldn't get in touch with them for three days. on the fourth day they scheduled me for another repair and then cancelled their appointment. on the fifth day they finally repaired their own mistake.
1156,"he did a repair for me once that was ok so i hired the company for my landscaping maintenance.  after two no-shows, i decided to not waste my time anymore."
1157,"i had this company come look at my water heater at my salon on jan. 23 2016. they charged me a little over $1000.00 to repair two valves, replace the anode rod inside the the heater and flush the unit.  i asked before all this work was done if i shouldn't just get a new unit, he said no this would fix it. 

on feb 6th the water heater has been running out of hot water for 5 days. i called them up and they said to replace the 75 gal hot water heater it would cost $2475.00 but they would credit me $500 dollars (since they repaired it 2 weeks ago) so the cost would be end up being $1975. i looked on line and the water heater costs $979.00 so basically they want to charge me $996.00 for installation.

 (scam artists)

this company is extremely expensive and they are not worth it. don't use them."
1158,terribly disappointed in albert.    we spoke the day prior and discussed the details of the job.   scheduled an appt for tile repair the following day.   a small job yes but still a job.   initial communication was very good and i was excited to have project done.  left work early to meet him.    he no called no showed and would not return texts or msg sent on yelp.    just bad business!!!!!!    a waste of my time and money.   i suggest you keep looking for someone more reliable.
1159,"can we have less stars? called to have a shower leak fixed. was told it would be $250 to cut the plaster to the leak ( and have to repair myself) then at least an additional $600 for an hour to fix the problem. $250 to cut a hole that would take 3-5 minutes!! called a competitor, completed the same job for $125. something very wrong here."
1160,"well, i'm not sure what is going on with this company.  we have always used them and found that their handymen were great and the prices fair.  but we were supposed to have someone over yesterday for a job.  we called the day before the job to confirm - no return call.  called yesterday to see if we were still on the books - no return call.  then i see the review posted by ""the owner"".  not sure if the review is legit or not, but it does seem that there is some kind of drama going on with this company.  that is too bad, especially when they were my go-to handyman.  looks like we need to find someone else."
1161,"first off i did not have any work performed by five guys. i contacted them after a big storm and they told me that they were busy and could come out next week. no problem, i had a few other roofers come by in the mean time to give estimates. five guys came out and spend about 10 minutes getting out a ladder and walking to the spot on the roof that leaked. snapped a few pictures and left. i got there estimate a day or so later... it was 3 times what other company's quoted! i think it's nonsense that they want to charge $50 to write a outrageous estimate and in my opinion had no intention on performing the work since they were busy from the storm that rolled through. what a joke! i had the repair done for a fraction of what five guys quoted... and didn't have to pay for an estimate."
1162,"i had to have my power tools repaired a few times.
although this place is 5 minutes from my place, i prefer to drive for an hour, to other, more distant repair centers. this place (with adam bilan as the owner) is horrible! they are rude, unprofessional, and they cannot fix the tools properly. i keep having the same issues with my tools only because they did not do a good job. they said they fixed the tools by replacing the parts with brand new, only for me to find out that nothing has been actually replaced. i guess they charge a lot of $$$ form the companies that make the tools, and they save on the parts by cheating the customers. what the f*** !!! btw, the wait time is the worst of all the places i ever dealt with. i will never again come to this place, ever!!! if you want your tools to get fixed properly, within reasonable time and be treated with respect and professionalism, stay away from this place! they are con artists, butchers, cheaters, nothing more!"
1163,i had perfect painters do some work in my home. they were poorly equipped there handyman had to borrow most of the tools needed from me. i was not worth what i was charged.
1164,road hazard with construction cones in the middle of the road on an interstate late at night. enterprise repair estimate for damage is in excess of $660. my estimate with the exact same parts numbers is under $300. what a ripoff
1165,yikes for being in the water front complex i was surprised at the disrepair the seats were torn and the roof was leaking also i'm surprised the ceiling tile were mismatched.i had a quarter pounder and i guess they didn't get the corporate email saying they were supposed to be freshly made because mine was really dry.
1166,"hired this contractor, referred by water damage restoration company, to oversee refurbishing my home after completion of mold remediation. projected completion date of 1 month ended up taking 3 months. very disappointed in workmanship. repeated promises by owner kirk nielson to repair and replace damaged items every day still not completed to date. it's now 6 months later and continue to receive excuse after excuse. will be filling with az registrar of contractors and bbb. very unfortunate."
1167,these guys cause more damage then they do repairs.  the repairs are sub standard.  they damaged many family heirlooms while at the home.
1168,"had them come out for an estimate to repair some tile around my patio bar and bbq. frankly, i wasn't impressed whatsoever. the estimator took several measurements and photos and then said he needed to get a ""stone guy"" to come out and look at the job. he explained that it was going to be a very ""tricky"" job and that he wanted me to know that it was not going to be an easy job. in contrast, the other 2 bids that i received from contractors, didn't have any issues at all. they accessed what needed to be done and  immediately provided reasonable bids. the only positive thing i can say about this company is that the estimator was on time."
1169,"my husband and i used kitchen and bath to renovate our two washrooms.  we decided to go with them, as they had a discount promotion running at the time and we liked that they had a showroom location with friendly staff.  
our designer was amazing, friendly and super patient with our demands.
however, once the work started, everything seemed to go downhill.  we had requested to have additional waterproofing installed (in which we paid quite a bit more for).  we were lucky that we went to check, as they forgot to install it.  every day we would have to babysit and contact them on things they were missing.  the contractors that came to work were super messy, leaving garbage all over our house.  since we weren't living there throughout the renovations, i think they thought it was okay to leave coffee cups and buckets of water all over our hardwood floors.
the work was sloppy.  they didn't grout under our vanity, and missed grout spots in our shower.  they forgot to caulk the shower faucet and handles (in which i had to point out, as i could pull them off the wall and look into the studs behind the shower).
overall the end result looks okay, but it was a struggle to get to the end."
1170,"repaired after a total of 6 complaints for the same issue within a month, 2 of which were cancelled by your staff without my knowledge, and after they changed the air filter, which had no impact on the issue. i've stated what i needed to say."
1171,"this is a terrible company. i went through my home warranty company and they sent out tyler from  dependable door systems who wrote a bogus report so the warranty company would not cover the repairs . so after paying the unreliable dependable door systems directly , the same issue retuned only worse  2 days later. when i called them to tell them the issue wasn't fixed and it was worse, virginia told me "" well it worked when he left so it worked even if it's intermittent "" huh??!!!  then she proceeded to tell me to take it up with the  home warranty company. whether the repair was going to be covered or not by the home warranty company was not a factor for me because i was willing to pay for honest and reliable repairs.  another company was sent out by my home warranty company and this time a real repair was completed . in short read all the terrible reviews and believe them!!!"
1172,"do not stay here!

40 minute wait to get checked in and then the keys didn't work.
35 minutes to get a new key.
i was here for a meeting. i would never recommend this place to anyone.
check in online and the wait was only 25
minutes.
while we were there we heard that the 
parent company caesars declared bankruptcy. the disrepair and lack of staff 
made sense.
the restaurants weren't bad. expensive though."
1173,"the worst. part 2 of my review. i'm now in the process of unpacking boxes and so much is damaged. they smashed a full box of well packed crystal in a box marked ""glass, vidrio, fragile"". they used a garment box with no hanger and balled up all my suits and put fragile wooden boxes on the bottom and lamps stuffed in on top! of course the boxes and the lampshades were crushed and the suits totally wrinkled. they smashed the ornate wooden filigree on an antique chinese cabinet that is costing 100's of dollars to repair. they broke a glass top for a table that cost $140 to replace. plus they held my load hostage until i paid $1100 more than the amount on the signed contract they gave me when they took my stuff away. crooks, liars, pirates. this company sucks."
1174,"i read the reviews and am just shocked   our experience would be less than 1 if it were possible   i see all of the 5 star reviews and question why are there not any 2 -4 reviews   something smells bad
bottom line a tech on a semi annual check up informed my elderly mother that her ac unit needed extensive repair and that she would be better off to replace it
i own rental property and had the company that i use come and check out the unit
their report the unit is working properly and in fact some of the parts they said were defective had recently been replaced. i am giving a true and accurate account of the events  bottom line i feel this company is very dishonest and tried to take advantage of a 90 year old single lady"
1175,"low quality homes built by low quality trades.  their sales people are disrespectful and dishonest.  their design center is a ripoff.  beware of their ""preferred"" third party builders.  they are just as dishonest as fulton homes and will try to rip you off.  their warranty department is a joke.  it is really a mitigation department that tries to fight you over every repair.  then the repairs are just as low quality as the build. buyers beware!"
1176,i wrote a negative review concerning the failure to repair an airbag problem after charging over $300.00.they replied that someone would call me to discuss the problem.no one ever did.
1177,"i was assigned air one to come repair my ac unit by my warranty company.

it took them 4 days to come out and asses the issue.

technician said the system needed a leak test and required 7 pounds of freon.

after warranty company approved the work to be done they were only able to come out and fix the issue 3 days after that. this was 8 days after the original diagnosis.

spoke with oren at air one and asked, pleaded with him to see if they could be out the day after the work approved. he said sorry we are too busy.

i called another contractor and they were out the next day to fix the issue.

the new contractor found that the system can only hold 3 pounds 14oz.i then validated that with the manufacturer and they sent me the spec sheets.

air one was attempting to bill me for 7 pounds of freon. since the warranty company only covers a portion of the cost, air one was going to charge me $595 for freon that i did not need.

the contractor that fixed the unit was only able to add 1.5  pounds of freon and replaced a capacitor.  he also added stop leak dye to the system but did not find a leak.total cost $345. 
this was much less costly than air one not to mention air one would be getting paid by warranty company for labor to do more of a job than what was required.
seemed like air one was taking advantage of me and the warranty company. 
i filed a complaint with the better business bureau to advise them of what looks like and felt like price gouging the consumers.

i would not recommend using this company."
1178,"once again, the repair man broke something else. he over tightened a clamp amd now it's leaking. 3 calls, no response. next call, bbb."
1179,repair was okay but was told i needed more work not done by this tech after i was billed for his work.  more time spent by his trying to sell me a $500 warranty than doing the actual work.
1180,"i have used this place for years with no issues, but recently things have changed. i purchased an inlet valve yesterday to replace the defective one in my dishwasher, but before i could get to the repair, my wife asked me to purchase a new dishwasher instead. i tried to return the part to have my 65.00 returned and was told that the receipt shows all sales are final. first of all this should be explained when purchasing and not just printed on a receipt. secondly, the part never touched my dishwasher, therefore could still be sold as new. i would have even been happy paying a 15% restocking fee like most normal companies charge. the part was 30.00 online, but i decided to impulse buy it from here for double the cost. i will not be returning here after this experience, as this is not good business."
1181,had to fix it correctly myself after paying a $100 warranty fee. was a straight run now pump is struggling after leak repair.
1182,"scam - run from this place. any chance they get they will bully you into paying double or even triple the average cost of the repair & will kindly finance the outrages amount for you. their sales techniques are borderline harassment, their demoralizing speech is fear based all because they will not take ""no"" for an answer, they will do whatever it takes to get your money. do not use this place!"
1183,"they lost $256.00 worth of clothes and only reimbursed $100 worth. i have had multiple problems with repairs and stuff not being done on time. this not a company i would recommend. stay away, they refuse to make things right, when they are at fault.
stay away!!!!"
1184,"earl came to look at my ac unit which was leaking through my kitchen ceiling. he called me and said there was nothing he could do to stop it i just needed a new unit. this company sent me a quote the following day for $8,278.00. of course this seemed high so i went through home advisor to get additional quotes. after receiving the other quotes, same day i might add, which were all between $6200.00 to $6700.00 for the exact same lennox system. i investigate all of the companies which were an a rating through bbb and home advisor. i had one come out this morning to verify what was told to me by alaskan and low and behold, they were able to repair the leak and clean the unit. i asked why they just didn't sell me the new unit and simply put they said my unit was functioning good and had a few more years left on it. all of that for $80.00 when earl charged me $78.00 and did nothing but left me with a leak in the middle of the kitchen for four days. it is a disgrace that companies such as this one are taking advantage of customers. no integrity!"
1185,"definitely wouldn't recommend this place for consoles.  i came for a free diagnosis for my xbox because it kept shutting off and ""aaron"" decided to do some repairs on it without my consent.  when i go pick up my xbox i get a bill of 55 dollars for labor and i was ok with it until i go home and it still isn't working.  i got my refund but don't appreciate aaron's attitude and him slipping in that 55 dollars for something that didn't fix my console."
1186,"disappointed! went there when they opened a couple of years ago for $8.95 admission. today it came to $17.32 for one 5 year old. way too expensive for what's offered, and at least one ride is usually unavailable due to needed repairs."
1187,i don't think this spot is open but not clear if it is closed for renovations or out of business especially with such great reviews. so sad i was unable to try a las vegas original
1188,played this course with my daughter and i   was mortified at the condition of this course...it was like an abandoned course that someone was collecting fees for!!  the range is in such disrepair it made me sick!  had i not promised my daughter we would go out and play....i would have never stayed....btw did i mention this fiasco of a course cost $40 for a 10yr old and myself.  grossly disappointed!!!!
1189,"update: took them to small claims court and won a judgment for the amount they took from me. if someone rips you off there are legal ways to redemption. it appears that someone else bought out the crook steven dynabursky, so hopefully the place will make an effort to repair their poor image."
1190,well our unit broke again. the guy came just a few months ago to do our last free tune up. he said everything looked good and now this morning we wake up to a freezing house with a two weeks old baby freaking out. so now that's three repairs in 2 years. we will not be having alaskan fix the problem this time. they charged way too much last time for something that is their fault. horrible company.
1191,"big big mistake!! avoid this company at all costs.  i spent over $11,000 with them for various repairs and painting for interior and exterior of my home.  unprofessional painters that had to return to my home to either touch up or complete the job.  6 times they returned to finish painting!!!  the owner morris doesn't know the meaning of ""the customer is always right"".  when they asked for money, i wrote the check, when i needed quality control and the owner to take responsibility - silence  until i had to threaten litigation.  never ever again!"
1192,"ok this photo is mis representation .. just to start out.. i read the reviews before making my appt hoping that this would be a great dr for me to work with being the one before was waay to far from me..]
there office waiting area smelled like a brothel.. had to put mask on i have m s and very sensitive to smells.. second they were running a bit late 45 min.. at first he seems quite and i came really prepair with notes and results which he didnt seem intersted at all,. i told him my allergies and as he put it sensitibies ok? well then he changed and just walked out. no words no update so i sat in the room for half hour and a asst of somesort said dr wanted me to move to other room he was doing a procdure on someone. well i told him the dr already said he couldnt do anything for me unless i did a very agressive typ eo surguyr in the hospital and i told him um no i choose not to do that at this time. its not worrented to me based on my history . if he would have let me finish explaing my past medical testing and so i it would have helped.. but no he just walked out.. period.. im going to seek other dr for help in my area hopfully with a much better result .. he didnt seeem to know any of the drs or p/t people in town.. werid."
1193,my experience they broke a hose and still have to pay for it since they broke it!! mofo's l!! 3 times i've been there worth over $500 on repair!! there flat rate for any repair is $500 and up!! don't get me wrong they do good job but damm come on man!! i still gotta pay for something that u guys broke!!
1194,"horrible communication, unprofessional staff. you can do all the renovation you want but when no one knows what they are doing i'd rather go to banner at this point"
1195,"i think this company should remove handyman from their description.  i needed help installing a gutter on the second story and i wanted a particular product, but they refused because they said they were not familiar with it.

isn't the very nature of a handyman to deal with the unfamiliar?  

anyway, looks like i'll need to find someone else."
1196,"since the renovation there is no longer an express desk doesn't sound like much but when they only have two cash registers open it makes a big difference, who though this was a good idea"
1197,"do not rent here even if you are desperate!!!

if i could give this place a lower rating i would. we lived here almost 3 years. are now being forced out because they didnt take the rent money from an organization that was trying to help us. we fell behind for rent 1 payment and instead of working with us like they did everyone else. they do not keep their words on repairs. i'd love to write more.. but i am on mobile."
